    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. SOME OPINIONS AND A WEDDING
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Bertram, take thee, Billy,&rdquo; chanted the white-robed clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I, Bertram, take thee, Billy,'&rdquo; echoed the tall young bridegroom, his
      eyes gravely tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my wedded wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'To my wedded wife.'&rdquo; The bridegroom's voice shook a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To have and to hold from this day forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'To have and to hold from this day forward.'&rdquo; Now the young voice rang
      with triumph. It had grown strong and steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For better for worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'For better for worse.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For richer for poorer,&rdquo; droned the clergyman, with the weariness of
      uncounted repetitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'For richer for poorer,'&rdquo; avowed the bridegroom, with the decisive
      emphasis of one to whom the words are new and significant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sickness and in health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'In sickness and in health.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To love and to cherish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'To love and to cherish.'&rdquo; The younger voice carried infinite tenderness
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till death us do part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Till death us do part,'&rdquo; repeated the bridegroom's lips; but everybody
      knew that what his heart said was: &ldquo;Now, and through all eternity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to God's holy ordinance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'According to God's holy ordinance.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thereto I plight thee my troth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And thereto I plight thee my troth.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a faint stir in the room. In one corner a white-haired woman
      blinked tear-wet eyes and pulled a fleecy white shawl more closely about
      her shoulders. Then the minister's voice sounded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Billy, take thee, Bertram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I, Billy, take thee, Bertram.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time the echoing voice was a feminine one, low and sweet, but clearly
      distinct, and vibrant with joyous confidence, on through one after another
      of the ever familiar, but ever impressive phrases of the service that
      gives into the hands of one man and of one woman the future happiness,
      each of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was at noon. That evening Mrs. Kate Hartwell, sister of the
      bridegroom, wrote the following letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      BOSTON, July 15th.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR HUSBAND:&mdash;Well, it's all over with, and they're married. I
      couldn't do one thing to prevent it. Much as ever as they would even
      listen to what I had to say&mdash;and when they knew how I had hurried
      East to say it, too, with only two hours' notice!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, what can you expect? From time immemorial lovers never did have
      any sense; and when those lovers are such irresponsible flutterbudgets as
      Billy and Bertram&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such a wedding! I couldn't do anything with <i>that</i>, either,
      though I tried hard. They had it in Billy's living-room at noon, with
      nothing but the sun for light. There was no maid of honor, no bridesmaids,
      no wedding cake, no wedding veil, no presents (except from the family, and
      from that ridiculous Chinese cook of brother William's, Ding Dong, or
      whatever his name is. He tore in just before the wedding ceremony, and
      insisted upon seeing Billy to give her a wretched little green stone idol,
      which he declared would bring her 'heap plenty velly good luckee' if she
      received it before she 'got married.' I wouldn't have the hideous,
      grinning thing around, but William says it's real jade, and very valuable,
      and of course Billy was crazy over it&mdash;or pretended to be). There was
      no trousseau, either, and no reception. There was no anything but the
      bridegroom; and when I tell you that Billy actually declared that was all
      she wanted, you will understand how absurdly in love she is&mdash;in spite
      of all those weeks and weeks of broken engagement when I, at least,
      supposed she had come to her senses, until I got that crazy note from
      Bertram a week ago saying they were to be married today.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say that I've got any really satisfactory explanation of the
      matter. Everything has been in such a hubbub, and those two ridiculous
      children have been so afraid they wouldn't be together every minute
      possible, that any really rational conversation with either of them was
      out of the question. When Billy broke the engagement last spring none of
      us knew why she had done it, as you know; and I fancy we shall be almost
      as much in the dark as to why she has&mdash;er&mdash;mended it now, as you
      might say. As near as I can make out, however, she thought he didn't want
      her, and he thought she didn't want him. I believe matters were still
      further complicated by a girl Bertram was painting, and a young fellow
      that used to sing with Billy&mdash;a Mr. Arkwright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, things came to a head last spring, Billy broke the engagement and
      fled to parts unknown with Aunt Hannah, leaving Bertram here in Boston to
      alternate between stony despair and reckless gayety, according to William;
      and it was while he was in the latter mood that he had that awful
      automobile accident and broke his arm&mdash;and almost his neck. He was
      wildly delirious, and called continually for Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it seems Billy didn't know all this; but a week ago she came home,
      and in some way found out about it, I think through Pete&mdash;William's
      old butler, you know. Just exactly what happened I can't say, but I do
      know that she dragged poor old Aunt Hannah down to Bertram's at some
      unearthly hour, and in the rain; and Aunt Hannah couldn't do a thing with
      her. All Billy would say, was, 'Bertram wants me.' And Aunt Hannah told me
      that if I could have seen Billy's face I'd have known that she'd have gone
      to Bertram then if he'd been at the top of the Himalaya Mountains, or at
      the bottom of the China Sea. So perhaps it's just as well&mdash;for Aunt
      Hannah's sake, at least&mdash;that he was in no worse place than on his
      own couch at home. Anyhow, she went, and in half an hour they blandly
      informed Aunt Hannah that they were going to be married to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Hannah said she tried to stop that, and get them to put it off till
      October (the original date, you know), but Bertram was obdurate. And when
      he declared he'd marry her the next day if it wasn't for the new license
      law, Aunt Hannah said she gave up for fear he'd get a special
      dispensation, or go to the Governor or the President, or do some other
      dreadful thing. (What a funny old soul Aunt Hannah is!) Bertram told <i>me</i>
      that he should never feel safe till Billy was really his; that she'd read
      something, or hear something, or think something, or get a letter from me
      (as if anything <i>I</i> could say would do any good-or harm!), and so
      break the engagement again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she's his now, so I suppose he's satisfied; though, for my part, I
      haven't changed my mind at all. I still say that they are not one bit
      suited to each other, and that matrimony will simply ruin his career.
      Bertram never has loved and never will love any girl long&mdash;except to
      paint. But if he simply <i>would</i> get married, why couldn't he have
      taken a nice, sensible domestic girl that would have kept him fed and
      mended?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not but that I'm very fond of Billy, as you know, dear; but imagine Billy
      as a wife&mdash;worse yet, a mother! Billy's a dear girl, but she knows
      about as much of real life and its problems as&mdash;as our little Kate. A
      more impulsive, irresponsible, regardless-of-consequences young woman I
      never saw. She can play divinely, and write delightful songs, I'll
      acknowledge; but what is that when a man is hungry, or has lost a button?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy has had her own way, and had everything she wanted for years now&mdash;a
      rather dangerous preparation for marriage, especially marriage to a fellow
      like Bertram who has had <i>his</i> own way and everything <i>he's</i>
      wanted for years. Pray, what's going to happen when those ways conflict,
      and neither one gets the thing wanted?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And think of her ignorance of cooking&mdash;but, there! What's the use?
      They're married now, and it can't be helped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, what a letter I've written! But I, had to talk to some one;
      besides, I'd promised I to let you know how matters stood as soon as I
      could. As you see, though, my trip East has been practically useless. I
      saw the wedding, to be sure, but I didn't prevent it, or even postpone it&mdash;though
      I meant to do one or the other, else I should never have made that
      tiresome journey half across the continent at two hours' notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, we shall see what we shall see. As for me, I'm dead tired. Good
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Affectionately yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;KATE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite naturally, Mrs. Kate Hartwell was not the only one who was thinking
      that evening of the wedding. In the home of Bertram's brother Cyril, Cyril
      himself was at the piano, but where his thoughts were was plain to be seen&mdash;or
      rather, heard; for from under his fingers there came the Lohengrin wedding
      march until all the room seemed filled with the scent of orange blossoms,
      the mistiness of floating veils, and the echoing peals of far-away organs
      heralding the &ldquo;Fair Bride and Groom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over by the table in the glowing circle of the shaded lamp, sat Marie,
      Cyril's wife, a dainty sewing-basket by her side. Her hands, however, lay
      idly across the stocking in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the music ceased, she drew a long sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a perfectly beautiful wedding that was! she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril whirled about on the piano stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a very sensible wedding,&rdquo; he said with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They looked so happy&mdash;both of them,&rdquo; went on Marie, dreamily; &ldquo;so&mdash;so
      sort of above and beyond everything about them, as if nothing ever, ever
      could trouble them&mdash;<i>now</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyril lifted his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Well, as I said before, it was a very <i>sensible</i> wedding,&rdquo; he
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Marie noticed the emphasis. She laughed, though her eyes looked
      a little troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, dear, of course, what you mean. <i>I</i> thought our wedding was
      beautiful; but I would have made it simpler if I'd realized in time how
      you&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I abhorred pink teas and purple pageants,&rdquo; he finished for her, with
      a frowning smile. &ldquo;Oh, well, I stood it&mdash;for the sake of what it
      brought me.&rdquo; His face showed now only the smile; the frown had vanished.
      For a man known for years to his friends as a &ldquo;hater of women and all
      other confusion,&rdquo; Cyril Henshaw was looking remarkably well-pleased with
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife of less than a year colored as she met his gaze. Hurriedly she
      picked up her needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed happily at her confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing? Is that my stocking?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look, half pain, half reproach, crossed her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cyril, of course not! You&mdash;you told me not to, long ago. You
      said my darns made&mdash;bunches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! I meant I didn't want to <i>wear</i> them,&rdquo; retorted the man, upon
      whom the tragic wretchedness of that half-sobbed &ldquo;bunches&rdquo; had been quite
      lost. &ldquo;I love to see you <i>mending</i> them,&rdquo; he finished, with an
      approving glance at the pretty little picture of domesticity before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A peculiar expression came to Marie's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cyril, you mean you <i>like</i> to have me mend them just for&mdash;for
      the sake of seeing me do it, when you <i>know</i> you won't ever wear
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; nodded the man, imperturbably. Then, with a sudden laugh, he
      asked: &ldquo;I wonder now, does Billy love to mend socks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie smiled, but she sighed, too, and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid not, Cyril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor cook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie laughed outright this time. The vaguely troubled look had fled from
      her eyes
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Billy's helped me beat eggs and butter sometimes, but I never knew
      her to cook a thing or want to cook a thing, but once; then she spent
      nearly two weeks trying to learn to make puddings&mdash;for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For <i>me!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie puckered her lips queerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I supposed they were for you at the time. At all events she was
      trying to make them for some one of you boys; probably it was really for
      Bertram, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Cyril. Then, after a minute, he observed: &ldquo;I judge Kate
      thinks Billy'll never make them&mdash;for anybody. I'm afraid Sister Kate
      isn't pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but Mrs. Hartwell was&mdash;was disappointed in the wedding,&rdquo;
       apologized Marie, quickly. &ldquo;You know she wanted it put off anyway, and she
      didn't like such a simple one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm-m; as usual Sister Kate forgot it wasn't her funeral&mdash;I mean, her
      wedding,&rdquo; retorted Cyril, dryly. &ldquo;Kate is never happy, you know, unless
      she's managing things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; nodded Marie, with a frowning smile of recollection at
      certain features of her own wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't approve of Billy's taste in guests, either,&rdquo; remarked Cyril,
      after a moment's silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought her guests were lovely,&rdquo; spoke up Marie, in quick defense. &ldquo;Of
      course, most of her social friends are away&mdash;in July; but Billy is
      never a society girl, you know, in spite of the way Society is always
      trying to lionize her and Bertram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course Kate knows that; but she says it seems as if Billy needn't
      have gone out and gathered in the lame and the halt and the blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Marie, with unusual sharpness for her. &ldquo;I suppose she
      said that just because of Mrs. Greggory's and Tommy Dunn's crutches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they didn't make a real festive-looking wedding party, you must
      admit,&rdquo; laughed Cyril; &ldquo;what with the bridegroom's own arm in a sling,
      too! But who were they all, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you knew Mrs. Greggory and Alice, of course&mdash;and Pete,&rdquo; smiled
      Marie. &ldquo;And wasn't Pete happy? Billy says she'd have had Pete if she had
      no one else; that there wouldn't have been any wedding, anyway, if it
      hadn't been for his telephoning Aunt Hannah that night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Will told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Tommy and the others&mdash;most of them were those people that
      Billy had at her home last summer for a two weeks' vacation&mdash;people,
      you know, too poor to give themselves one, and too proud to accept one
      from ordinary charity. Billy's been following them up and doing little
      things for them ever since&mdash;sugarplums and frosting on their cake,
      she calls it; and they adore her, of course. I think it was lovely of her
      to have them, and they did have such a good time! You should have seen
      Tommy when you played that wedding march for Billy to enter the room. His
      poor little face was so transfigured with joy that I almost cried, just to
      look at him. Billy says he loves music&mdash;poor little fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope they'll be happy, in spite of Kate's doleful prophecies.
      Certainly they looked happy enough to-day,&rdquo; declared Cyril, patting a yawn
      as he rose to his feet. &ldquo;I fancy Will and Aunt Hannah are lonesome,
      though, about now,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; smiled Marie, mistily, as she gathered up her work. &ldquo;I know what
      Aunt Hannah's doing. She's helping Rosa put the house to rights, and she's
      stopping to cry over every slipper and handkerchief of Billy's she finds.
      And she'll do that until that funny clock of hers strikes twelve, then
      she'll say 'Oh, my grief and conscience&mdash;midnight!' But the next
      minute she'll remember that it's only half-past eleven, after all, and
      she'll send Rosa to bed and sit patting Billy's slipper in her lap till it
      really is midnight by all the other clocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyril laughed appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know what Will is doing,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will is in Bertram's den dozing before the fireplace with Spunkie curled
      up in his lap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it happened, both these surmises were not far from right. In the
      Strata, the Henshaws' old Beacon Street home, William was sitting before
      the fireplace with the cat in his lap, but he was not dozing. He was
      talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spunkie,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;your master, Bertram, got married to-day&mdash;and
      to Miss Billy. He'll be bringing her home one of these days&mdash;your new
      mistress. And such a mistress! Never did cat or house have a better!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think; for the first time in years this old place is to know the
      touch of a woman's hand&mdash;and that's what it hasn't known for almost
      twenty years, except for those few short months six years ago when a
      dark-eyed girl and a little gray kitten (that was Spunk, your predecessor,
      you know) blew in and blew out again before we scarcely knew they were
      here. That girl was Miss Billy, and she was a dear then, just as she is
      now, only now she's coming here to stay. She's coming home, Spunkie; and
      she'll make it a home for you, for me, and for all of us. Up to now, you
      know, it hasn't really been a home, for years&mdash;just us men, so. It'll
      be very different, Spunkie, as you'll soon find out. Now mind, madam! We
      must show that we appreciate all this: no tempers, no tantrums, no showing
      of claws, no leaving our coats&mdash;either yours or mine&mdash;on the
      drawing-room chairs, no tracking in of mud on clean rugs and floors! For
      we're going to have a home, Spunkie&mdash;a home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Hillside, Aunt Hannah was, indeed, helping Rosa to put the house to
      rights, as Marie had said. She was crying, too, over a glove she had found
      on Billy's piano; but she was crying over something else, also. Not only
      had she lost Billy, but she had lost her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, nothing had been said during that nightmare of a week of hurry
      and confusion about Aunt Hannah's future; but Aunt Hannah knew very well
      how it must be. This dear little house on the side of Corey Hill was
      Billy's home, and Billy would not need it any longer. It would be sold, of
      course; and she, Aunt Hannah, would go back to a &ldquo;second-story front&rdquo; and
      loneliness in some Back Bay boarding-house; and a second story front and
      loneliness would not be easy now, after these years of home&mdash;and
      Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder, indeed, that Aunt Hannah sat crying and patting the little
      white glove in her hand. No wonder, too, that&mdash;being Aunt Hannah&mdash;she
      reached for the shawl near by and put it on, shiveringly. Even July,
      to-night, was cold&mdash;to Aunt Hannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      In yet another home that evening was the wedding of Billy Neilson and
      Bertram Henshaw uppermost in thought and speech. In a certain little
      South-End flat where, in two rented rooms, lived Alice Greggory and her
      crippled mother, Alice was talking to Mr. M. J. Arkwright, commonly known
      to his friends as &ldquo;Mary Jane,&rdquo; owing to the mystery in which he had for so
      long shrouded his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright to-night was plainly moody and ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not listening. You're not listening at all,&rdquo; complained Alice
      Greggory at last, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a visible effort the man roused himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I am,&rdquo; he maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you'd be interested in the wedding. You used to be friends&mdash;you
      and Billy.&rdquo; The girl's voice still vibrated with reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence; then, a little harshly, the man said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;because I wanted to be more than&mdash;a friend&mdash;is
      why you're not satisfied with my interest now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look that was almost terror came to Alice Greggory's eyes. She flushed
      painfully, then grew very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he nodded dully, without looking up. &ldquo;I cared too much for her. I
      supposed Henshaw was just a friend&mdash;till too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a breathless hush before, a little unsteadily, the girl
      stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm so sorry&mdash;so very sorry! I&mdash;I didn't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course you didn't. I've almost told you, though, lots of times;
      you've been so good to me all these weeks.&rdquo; He raised his head now, and
      looked at her, frank comradeship in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stirred restlessly. Her eyes swerved a little under his level
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I've done nothing&mdash;n-nothing,&rdquo; she stammered. Then, at the
      light tap of crutches on a bare floor she turned in obvious relief. &ldquo;Oh,
      here's mother. She's been in visiting with Mrs. Delano, our landlady.
      Mother, Mr. Arkwright is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, speeding north as fast as steam could carry them, were the
      bride and groom. The wondrousness of the first hour of their journey side
      by side had become a joyous certitude that always it was to be like this
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram,&rdquo; began the bride, after a long minute of eloquent silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know our wedding was very different from most weddings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but <i>really</i> it was. Now listen.&rdquo; The bride's voice grew
      tenderly earnest. &ldquo;I think our marriage is going to be different, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Different?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Billy's tone was emphatic. &ldquo;There are so many common, everyday
      marriages where&mdash;where&mdash;Why, Bertram, as if you could ever be to
      me like&mdash;like Mr. Carleton is, for instance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Mr. Carleton is&mdash;to you?&rdquo; Bertram's voice was frankly puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! As Mr. Carleton is to Mrs. Carleton, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Bertram subsided in relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Grahams and Whartons, and the Freddie Agnews, and&mdash;and a lot
      of others. Why, Bertram, I've seen the Grahams and the Whartons not even
      speak to each other a whole evening, when they've been at a dinner, or
      something; and I've seen Mrs. Carleton not even seem to know her husband
      came into the room. I don't mean quarrel, dear. Of course we'd never <i>quarrel!</i>
      But I mean I'm sure we shall never get used to&mdash;to you being you, and
      I being I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed we sha'n't,&rdquo; agreed Bertram, rapturously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ours is going to be such a beautiful marriage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we'll be so happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be, and I shall try to make you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I could be anything else,&rdquo; sighed Billy, blissfully. &ldquo;And now we <i>can't</i>
      have any misunderstandings, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. Er&mdash;what's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I mean that&mdash;that we can't ever repeat hose miserable weeks of
      misunderstanding. Everything is all explained up. I <i>know</i>, now, that
      you don't love Miss Winthrop, or just girls&mdash;any girl&mdash;to paint.
      You love me. Not the tilt of my chin, nor the turn of my head; but <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do&mdash;just you.&rdquo; Bertram's eyes gave the caress his lips would have
      given had it not been for the presence of the man in the seat across the
      aisle of the sleeping-car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;you know now that I love you&mdash;just you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even Arkwright?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even Arkwright,&rdquo; smiled Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the briefest of hesitations; then, a little constrainedly,
      Bertram asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you said you&mdash;you never <i>had</i> cared for Arkwright, didn't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the second time in her life Billy was thankful that Bertram's question
      had turned upon <i>her</i> love for Arkwright, not Arkwright's love for
      her. In Billy's opinion, a man's unrequited love for a girl was his
      secret, not hers, and was certainly one that the girl had no right to
      tell. Once before Bertram had asked her if she had ever cared for
      Arkwright, and then she had answered emphatically, as she did now:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you said so,&rdquo; murmured Bertram, relaxing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did; besides, didn't I tell you?&rdquo; she went on airily, &ldquo;I think he'll
      marry Alice Greggory. Alice wrote me all the time I was away, and&mdash;oh,
      she didn't say anything definite, I'll admit,&rdquo; confessed Billy, with an
      arch smile; &ldquo;but she spoke of his being there lots, and they used to know
      each other years ago, you see. There was almost a romance there, I think,
      before the Greggorys lost their money and moved away from all their
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he may have her. She's a nice girl&mdash;a mighty nice girl,&rdquo;
       answered Bertram, with the unmistakably satisfied air of the man who knows
      he himself possesses the nicest girl of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, reading unerringly the triumph in his voice, grew suddenly grave.
      She regarded her husband with a thoughtful frown; then she drew a profound
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; laughed Bertram, whimsically. &ldquo;So soon as this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram!&rdquo; Billy's voice was tragic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my love.&rdquo; The bridegroom pulled his face into sobriety; then Billy
      spoke, with solemn impressiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram, I don't know a thing about&mdash;cooking&mdash;except what I've
      been learning in Rosa's cook-book this last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram laughed so loud that the man across the aisle glanced over the top
      of his paper surreptitiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosa's cook-book! Is that what you were doing all this week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that is&mdash;I tried so hard to learn something,&rdquo; stammered Billy.
      &ldquo;But I'm afraid I didn't&mdash;much; there were so many things for me to
      think of, you know, with only a week. I believe I <i>could</i> make peach
      fritters, though. They were the last thing I studied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram laughed again, uproariously; but, at Billy's unchangingly tragic
      face, he grew suddenly very grave and tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, dear, I didn't marry you to&mdash;to get a cook,&rdquo; he said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; but Aunt Hannah said that even if I never expected to cook,
      myself, I ought to know how it was done, so to properly oversee it. She
      said that&mdash;that no woman, who didn't know how to cook and keep house
      properly, had any business to be a wife. And, Bertram, I did try,
      honestly, all this week. I tried so hard to remember when you sponged
      bread and when you kneaded it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't ever need&mdash;<i>yours</i>,&rdquo; cut in Bertram, shamelessly; but
      he got only a deservedly stern glance in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I repeated over and over again how many cupfuls of flour and pinches
      of salt and spoonfuls of baking-powder went into things; but, Bertram, I
      simply could not keep my mind on it. Everything, everywhere was singing to
      me. And how do you suppose I could remember how many pinches of flour and
      spoonfuls of salt and cupfuls of baking-powder went into a loaf of cake
      when all the while the very teakettle on the stove was singing: 'It's all
      right&mdash;Bertram loves me&mdash;I'm going to marry Bertram!'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You darling!&rdquo; (In spite of the man across the aisle Bertram did almost
      kiss her this time.) &ldquo;As if anybody cared how many cupfuls of
      baking-powder went anywhere&mdash;with that in your heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Hannah says you will&mdash;when you're hungry. And Kate said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram uttered a sharp word behind his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, for heaven's sake don't tell me what Kate said, if you want me to
      stay sane, and not attempt to fight somebody&mdash;broken arm, and all.
      Kate <i>thinks</i> she's kind, and I suppose she means well; but&mdash;well,
      she's made trouble enough between us already. I've got you now,
      sweetheart. You're mine&mdash;all mine&mdash;&rdquo; his voice shook, and
      dropped to a tender whisper&mdash;&ldquo;'till death us do part.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; 'till death us do part,'&rdquo; breathed Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, for a time, they fell silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I, Bertram, take thee, Billy,'&rdquo; sang the whirring wheels beneath them,
      to one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I, Billy, take thee, Bertram,'&rdquo; sang the whirring wheels beneath them,
      to the other. While straight ahead before them both, stretched fair and
      beautiful in their eyes, the wondrous path of life which they were to
      tread together.

      On the first Sunday after the wedding Pete came up-stairs to tell his
      master, William, that Mrs. Stetson wanted to see him in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      William went down at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Aunt Hannah,&rdquo; he began, reaching out a cordial hand. &ldquo;Why, what's
      the matter?&rdquo; he broke off concernedly, as he caught a clearer view of the
      little old lady's drawn face and troubled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William, it's silly, of course,&rdquo; cried Aunt Hannah, tremulously, &ldquo;but I
      simply had to go to some one. I&mdash;I feel so nervous and unsettled! Did&mdash;did
      Billy say anything to you&mdash;what she was going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What she was going to do? About what? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the house&mdash;selling it,&rdquo; faltered Aunt Hannah, sinking wearily
      back into her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      William frowned thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It was all so hurried at the last, you know.
      There was really very little chance to make plans for anything&mdash;except
      the wedding,&rdquo; he finished, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; sighed Aunt Hannah. &ldquo;Everything was in such confusion!
      Still, I didn't know but she might have said something&mdash;to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she didn't. But I imagine it won't be hard to guess what she'll do.
      When they get back from their trip I fancy she won't lose much time in
      having what things she wants brought down here. Then she'll sell the rest
      and put the house on the market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of&mdash;of course,&rdquo; stammered Aunt Hannah, pulling herself hastily
      to a more erect position. &ldquo;That's what I thought, too. Then don't you
      think we'd better dismiss Rosa and close the house at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes, perhaps so. Why not? Then you'd be all settled here when
      she comes home. I'm sure, the sooner you come, the better I'll be
      pleased,&rdquo; he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah turned sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;William Henshaw, you didn't suppose I was coming
      <i>here</i> to live, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was William's turn to look amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course you're coming here! Where else should you go, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where I was before&mdash;before Billy came&mdash;to you,&rdquo; returned Aunt
      Hannah a little tremulously, but with a certain dignity. &ldquo;I shall take a
      room in some quiet boarding-house, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Aunt Hannah! As if Billy would listen to that! You came before;
      why not come now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah lifted her chin the fraction of an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget. I was needed before. Billy is a married woman now. She needs
      no chaperon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; scowled William, again. &ldquo;Billy will always need you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah shook her head mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to think&mdash;she wants me, William, but I know, in my heart, it
      isn't best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's pause; then, decisively came the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I think young married folks should not have outsiders in the
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William laughed relievedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so that's it! Well, Aunt Hannah, you're no outsider. Come, run right
      along home and pack your trunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah was plainly almost crying; but she held her ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William, I can't,&rdquo; she reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;Billy is such a child, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For once in her circumspect life Aunt Hannah was guilty of an
      interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, William, she is not a child. She is a woman now, and she has a
      woman's problems to meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, why don't you help her meet them?&rdquo; retorted William, still
      with a whimsical smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Hannah did not smile. For a minute she did not speak; then, with
      her eyes studiously averted, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William, the first four years of my married life were&mdash;were spoiled
      by an outsider in our home. I don't mean to spoil Billy's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William relaxed visibly. The smile fled from his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;Aunt&mdash;Hannah!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little old lady turned with a weary sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. You are shocked, of course. I shouldn't have told you.
      Still, it is all past long ago, and&mdash;I wanted to make you understand
      why I can't come. He was my husband's eldest brother&mdash;a bachelor. He
      was good and kind, and meant well, I suppose; but&mdash;he interfered with
      everything. I was young, and probably headstrong. At all events, there was
      constant friction. He went away once and stayed two whole months. I shall
      never forget the utter freedom and happiness of those months for us, with
      the whole house to ourselves. No, William, I can't come.&rdquo; She rose
      abruptly and turned toward the door. Her eyes were wistful, and her face
      was still drawn with suffering; but her whole frail little self quivered
      plainly with high resolve. &ldquo;John has Peggy outside. I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but, Aunt Hannah,&rdquo; began William, helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted a protesting hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't urge me, please. I can't come here. But&mdash;I believe I won't
      close the house till Billy gets home, after all,&rdquo; she declared. The next
      moment she was gone, and William, dazedly, from the doorway, was watching
      John help her into Billy's automobile, called by Billy and half her
      friends, &ldquo;Peggy,&rdquo; short for &ldquo;Pegasus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still dazedly William turned back into the house and dropped himself into
      the nearest chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a curious call it had been! Aunt Hannah had not acted like herself at
      all. Not once had she said &ldquo;Oh, my grief and conscience!&rdquo; while the things
      she <i>had</i> said&mdash;! Someway, he had never thought of Aunt Hannah
      as being young, and a bride. Still, of course she must have been&mdash;once.
      And the reason she gave for not coming there to live&mdash;the pitiful
      story of that outsider in her home! But she was no outsider! She was no
      interfering brother of Billy's&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      William caught his breath suddenly, and held it suspended. Then he gave a
      low ejaculation and half sprang from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spunkie, disturbed from her doze by the fire, uttered a purring &ldquo;me-o-ow,&rdquo;
       and looked up inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long minute William gazed dumbly into the cat's yellow, sleepily
      contented eyes; then he said with tragic distinctness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spunkie, it's true: Aunt Hannah isn't Billy's husband's brother, but&mdash;I
      am! Do you hear? I <i>am!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pur-r-me-ow!&rdquo; commented Spunkie; and curled herself for another nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no peace for William after that. In vain he told himself that he
      was no &ldquo;interfering&rdquo; brother, and that this was his home and had been all
      his life; in vain did he declare emphatically that he could not go, he
      would not go; that Billy would not wish him to go: always before his eyes
      was the vision of that little bride of years long gone; always in his ears
      was the echo of Aunt Hannah's &ldquo;I shall never forget the utter freedom and
      happiness of those months for us, with the whole house to ourselves.&rdquo; Nor,
      turn which way he would, could he find anything to comfort him. Simply
      because he was so fearfully looking for it, he found it&mdash;the thing
      that had for its theme the wretchedness that might be expected from the
      presence of a third person in the new home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor William! Everywhere he met it&mdash;the hint, the word, the story,
      the song, even; and always it added its mite to the woeful whole. Even the
      hoariest of mother-in-law jokes had its sting for him; and, to make his
      cup quite full, he chanced to remember one day what Marie had said when he
      had suggested that she and Cyril come to the Strata to live: &ldquo;No; I think
      young folks should begin by themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unhappy, indeed, were these days for William. Like a lost spirit he
      wandered from room to room, touching this, fingering that. For long
      minutes he would stand before some picture, or some treasured bit of old
      mahogany, as if to stamp indelibly upon his mind a thing that was soon to
      be no more. At other times, like a man without a home, he would go out
      into the Common or the Public Garden and sit for hours on some bench&mdash;thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this could have but one ending, of course. Before the middle of August
      William summoned Pete to his rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pete, I'm going to move next week,&rdquo; he began nonchalantly. His voice
      sounded as if moving were a pleasurable circumstance that occurred in his
      life regularly once a month. &ldquo;I'd like you to begin to pack up these
      things, please, to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old servant's mouth fell open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're goin' to&mdash;to what, sir?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move&mdash;<i>move</i>, I said.&rdquo; William spoke with unusual harshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete wet his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you've sold the old place, sir?&mdash;that we&mdash;we ain't
      goin' to live here no longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sold? Of course not! <i>I'm</i> going to move away; not you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Pete could have known what caused the sharpness in his master's voice,
      he would not have been so grieved&mdash;or, rather, he would have been
      grieved for a different reason. As it was he could only falter miserably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> are goin' to move away from here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, man! Why, Pete, what ails you? One would think a body never
      moved before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn't&mdash;not you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William turned abruptly, so that his face could not be seen. With stern
      deliberation he picked up an elaborately decorated teapot; but the
      valuable bit of Lowestoft shook so in his hand that he set it down at
      once. It clicked sharply against its neighbor, betraying his nervous hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. William,&rdquo; he stammered thickly; &ldquo;how are you&mdash;what'll you
      do without&mdash;There doesn't nobody but me know so well about your tea,
      and the two lumps in your coffee; and there's your flannels that you never
      put on till I get 'em out, and the woolen socks that you'd wear all summer
      if I didn't hide 'em. And&mdash;and who's goin' to take care of these?&rdquo; he
      finished, with a glance that encompassed the overflowing cabinets and
      shelves of curios all about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His master smiled sadly. An affection that had its inception in his
      boyhood days shone in his eyes. The hand in which the Lowestoft had shaken
      rested now heavily on an old man's bent shoulder&mdash;a shoulder that
      straightened itself in unconscious loyalty under the touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete, you have spoiled me, and no mistake. I don't expect to find another
      like you. But maybe if I wear the woolen socks too late you'll come and
      hunt up the others for me. Eh?&rdquo; And, with a smile that was meant to be
      quizzical, William turned and began to shift the teapots about again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. William, why&mdash;that is, what will Mr. Bertram and Miss Billy
      do&mdash;without you?&rdquo; ventured the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden tinkling crash. On the floor lay the fragments of a
      silver-luster teapot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant exclaimed aloud in dismay, but his master did not even glance
      toward his once treasured possession on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Pete!&rdquo; he was saying in a particularly cheery voice. &ldquo;Have you
      lived all these years and not found out that newly-married folks don't <i>need</i>
      any one else around? Come, do you suppose we could begin to pack these
      teapots to-night?&rdquo; he added, a little feverishly. &ldquo;Aren't there some boxes
      down cellar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see, sir,&rdquo; said Pete, respectfully; but the expression on his face
      as he turned away showed that he was not thinking of teapots&mdash;nor of
      boxes in which to pack them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. BILLY SPEAKS HER MIND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Bertram Henshaw were expected home the first of September. By
      the thirty-first of August the old Beacon Street homestead facing the
      Public Garden was in spick-and-span order, with Dong Ling in the basement
      hovering over a well-stocked larder, and Pete searching the rest of the
      house for a chair awry, or a bit of dust undiscovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice before had the Strata&mdash;as Bertram long ago dubbed the home of
      his boyhood&mdash;been prepared for the coming of Billy, William's
      namesake: once, when it had been decorated with guns and fishing-rods to
      welcome the &ldquo;boy&rdquo; who turned out to be a girl; and again when with pink
      roses and sewing-baskets the three brothers got joyously ready for a
      feminine Billy who did not even come at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house had been very different then. It had been, indeed, a &ldquo;strata,&rdquo;
       with its distinctive layers of fads and pursuits as represented by Bertram
      and his painting on one floor, William and his curios on another, and
      Cyril with his music on a third. Cyril was gone now. Only Pete and his
      humble belongings occupied the top floor. The floor below, too, was silent
      now, and almost empty save for a rug or two, and a few pieces of heavy
      furniture that William had not cared to take with him to his new quarters
      on top of Beacon Hill. Below this, however, came Billy's old rooms, and on
      these Pete had lavished all his skill and devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freshly laundered curtains were at the windows, dustless rugs were on the
      floor. The old work-basket had been brought down from the top-floor
      storeroom, and the long-closed piano stood invitingly open. In a
      conspicuous place, also, sat the little green god, upon whose exquisitely
      carved shoulders was supposed to rest the &ldquo;heap plenty velly good luckee&rdquo;
       of Dong Ling's prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first floor Bertram's old rooms and the drawing-room came in for
      their share of the general overhauling. Even Spunkie did not escape, but
      had to submit to the ignominy of a bath. And then dawned fair and clear
      the first day of September, bringing at five o'clock the bride and groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respectfully lined up in the hall to meet them were Pete and Dong Ling:
      Pete with his wrinkled old face alight with joy and excitement; Dong Ling
      grinning and kotowing, and chanting in a high-pitched treble:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Billee, Miss Billee&mdash;plenty much welcome, Miss Billee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, welcome home, Mrs. <i>Henshaw!</i>&rdquo; bowed Bertram, turning at the
      door, with an elaborate flourish that did not in the least hide his tender
      pride in his new wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed and colored a pretty pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;all of you,&rdquo; she cried a little unsteadily. &ldquo;And how
      good, good everything does look to me! Why, where's Uncle William?&rdquo; she
      broke off, casting hurriedly anxious eyes about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should say so,&rdquo; echoed Bertram. &ldquo;Where is he, Pete? He isn't
      sick, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quick change crossed the old servant's face. He shook his head dumbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy gave a gleeful laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;he's asleep!&rdquo; she caroled, skipping to the bottom of the
      stairway and looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, Uncle William! Better wake up, sir. The folks have come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. William isn't here, Miss&mdash;ma'am,&rdquo; he corrected miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy smiled, but she frowned, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here! Well, I like that,&rdquo; she pouted; &ldquo;&mdash;and when I've brought
      him the most beautiful pair of mirror knobs he ever saw, and all the way
      in my bag, too, so I could give them to him the very first thing,&rdquo; she
      added, darting over to the small bag she had brought in with her. &ldquo;I'm
      glad I did, too, for our trunks didn't come,&rdquo; she continued laughingly.
      &ldquo;Still, if he isn't here to receive them&mdash;There, Pete, aren't they
      beautiful?&rdquo; she cried, carefully taking from their wrappings two
      exquisitely decorated porcelain discs mounted on two long spikes. &ldquo;They're
      Batterseas&mdash;the real article. I know enough for that; and they're
      finer than anything he's got. Won't he be pleased?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss&mdash;ma'am, I mean,&rdquo; stammered the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These new titles come hard, don't they, Pete?&rdquo; laughed Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Pete,&rdquo; soothed his new mistress. &ldquo;You shall call me 'Miss
      Billy' all your life if you want to. Bertram,&rdquo; she added, turning to her
      husband, &ldquo;I'm going to just run up-stairs and put these in Uncle William's
      rooms so they'll be there when he comes in. We'll see how soon he
      discovers them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Pete could stop her she was half-way up the first flight of stairs.
      Even then he tried to speak to his young master, to explain that Mr.
      William was not living there; but the words refused to come. He could only
      stand dumbly waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a minute it came&mdash;Billy's sharp, startled cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram! Bertram!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram sprang for the stairway, but he had not reached the top when he
      met his wife coming down. She was white-faced and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram&mdash;those rooms&mdash;there's not so much as a teapot there!
      Uncle William's&mdash;gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Bertram wheeled sharply. &ldquo;Pete, what is the meaning of this? Where
      is my brother?&rdquo; To hear him, one would think he suspected the old servant
      of having hidden his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete lifted a shaking hand and fumbled with his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's moved, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moved! Oh, you mean to other rooms&mdash;to Cyril's.&rdquo; Bertram relaxed
      visibly. &ldquo;He's upstairs, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. He's moved away&mdash;out of the house, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a brief moment Bertram stared as if he could not believe what his ears
      had heard. Then, step by step, he began to descend the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;to say&mdash;that my brother&mdash;has moved-gone away&mdash;<i>left</i>&mdash;his
      <i>home?</i>&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy gave a low cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why&mdash;why?&rdquo; she choked, almost stumbling headlong down the
      stairway in her effort to reach the two men at the bottom. &ldquo;Pete, why did
      he go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete,&rdquo;&mdash;Bertram's voice was very sharp&mdash;&ldquo;what is the meaning of
      this? Do you know why my brother left his home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man wet his lips and swallowed chokingly, but he did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm waiting, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laid one hand on the old servant's arm&mdash;in the other hand she
      still tightly clutched the mirror knobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete, if you do know, won't you tell us, please?&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete looked down at the hand, then up at the troubled young face with the
      beseeching eyes. His own features worked convulsively. With a visible
      effort he cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;what he said,&rdquo; he stammered, his eyes averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Pete, you'll have to tell us, you know,&rdquo; cut in Bertram,
      decisively, &ldquo;so you might as well do it now as ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more Pete cleared his throat. This time the words came in a burst of
      desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I understand, sir. It was only that he said&mdash;he said as
      how young folks didn't <i>need</i> any one else around. So he was goin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't <i>need</i> any one else!&rdquo; exclaimed Bertram, plainly not
      comprehending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. You two bein' married so, now.&rdquo; Pete's eyes were still averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy gave a low cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;because <i>I</i> came?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, Miss&mdash;no&mdash;that is&mdash;&rdquo; Pete stopped with an
      appealing glance at Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was&mdash;it <i>was</i>&mdash;on account of <i>me</i>,&rdquo; choked
      Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete looked still more distressed
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;It was only that he thought you wouldn't want him
      here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want him here!&rdquo; ejaculated Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want him here!&rdquo; echoed Billy, with a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete, where is he?&rdquo; As she asked the question she dropped the mirror
      knobs into her open bag, and reached for her coat and gloves&mdash;she had
      not removed her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete gave the address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's just down the street a bit and up the hill,&rdquo; he added excitedly,
      divining her purpose. &ldquo;It's a sort of a boarding-house, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A <i>boarding-house</i>&mdash;for Uncle William!&rdquo; scorned Billy, her eyes
      ablaze. &ldquo;Come, Bertram, we'll see about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram reached out a detaining hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dearest, you're so tired,&rdquo; he demurred. &ldquo;Hadn't we better wait till
      after dinner, or till to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After dinner! To-morrow!&rdquo; Billy's eyes blazed anew. &ldquo;Why, Bertram
      Henshaw, do you think I'd leave that dear man even one minute longer, if I
      could help it, with a notion in his blessed old head that we didn't <i>want</i>
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said a little while ago you had a headache, dear,&rdquo; still objected
      Bertram. &ldquo;If you'd just eat your dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner!&rdquo; choked Billy. &ldquo;I wonder if you think I could eat any dinner with
      Uncle William turned out of his home! I'm going to find Uncle William.&rdquo;
       And she stumbled blindly toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram reached for his hat. He threw a despairing glance into Pete's
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll be back&mdash;when we can,&rdquo; he said, with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Pete, respectfully. Then, as if impelled by some
      hidden force, he touched his master's arm. &ldquo;It was that way she looked,
      sir, when she came to <i>you</i>&mdash;that night last July&mdash;with her
      eyes all shining,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tender smile curved Bertram's lips. The frown vanished from his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, Pete&mdash;and bless her, too!&rdquo; he whispered back. The next
      moment he had hurried after his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house that bore the number Pete had given proved to have a pretentious
      doorway, and a landlady who, in response to the summons of the neat maid,
      appeared with a most impressive rustle of black silk and jet bugles.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Mr. William Henshaw was not in his rooms. In fact, he was very seldom
      there. His business, she believed, called him to State Street through the
      day. Outside of that, she had been told, he spent much time sitting on a
      bench in the Common. Doubtless, if they cared to search, they could find
      him there now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bench in the Common, indeed!&rdquo; stormed Billy, as she and Bertram hurried
      down the wide stone steps. &ldquo;Uncle William&mdash;on a bench!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely now, dear,&rdquo; ventured her husband, &ldquo;you'll come home and get
      your dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy turned indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And leave Uncle William on a bench in the Common? Indeed, no! Why,
      Bertram, you wouldn't, either,&rdquo; she cried, as she turned resolutely toward
      one of the entrances to the Common.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Bertram, with the &ldquo;eyes all shining&rdquo; still before him, could only
      murmur: &ldquo;No, of course not, dear!&rdquo; and follow obediently where she led.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under ordinary circumstances it would have been a delightful hour for a
      walk. The sun had almost set, and the shadows lay long across the grass.
      The air was cool and unusually bracing for a day so early in September.
      But all this was lost on Bertram. Bertram did not wish to take a walk. He
      was hungry. He wanted his dinner; and he wanted, too, his old home with
      his new wife flitting about the rooms as he had pictured this first
      evening together. He wanted William, of course. Certainly he wanted
      William; but if William would insist on running away and sitting on park
      benches in this ridiculous fashion, he ought to take the consequences&mdash;until
      to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed. Up one path and down another trudged
      the anxious-eyed Billy and her increasingly impatient husband. Then when
      the fifteen weary minutes had become a still more weary half-hour, the
      bonds Bertram had set on his temper snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; he remonstrated despairingly, &ldquo;do, please, come home! Don't you
      see how highly improbable it is that we should happen on William if we
      walked like this all night? He might move&mdash;change his seat&mdash;go
      home, even. He probably has gone home. And surely never before did a bride
      insist on spending the first evening after her return tramping up and down
      a public park for hour after hour like this, looking for any man. <i>Won't</i>
      you come home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Billy had not even heard. With a glad little cry she had darted to the
      side of the humped-up figure of a man alone on a park bench just ahead of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle William! Oh, Uncle William, how could you?&rdquo; she cried, dropping
      herself on to one end of the seat and catching the man's arm in both her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, how could you?&rdquo; demanded Bertram, with just a touch of irritation,
      dropping himself on to the other end of the seat, and catching the man's
      other arm in his one usable hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bent shoulders and bowed head straightened up with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, bless my soul! If it isn't our little bride,&rdquo; cried Uncle
      William, fondly. &ldquo;And the happy bridegroom, too. When did you get home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven't got home,&rdquo; retorted Bertram, promptly, before his wife could
      speak. &ldquo;Oh, we looked in at the door an hour or so back; but we didn't
      stay. We've been hunting for you ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, children!&rdquo; Uncle William spoke with gay cheeriness; but he
      refused to meet either Billy's or Bertram's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle William, how could you do it?&rdquo; reproached Billy, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Uncle William was plainly fencing for time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the house like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! I wanted a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if we'd believe that!&rdquo; scoffed Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; let's call it you've had the change, then,&rdquo; laughed Bertram,
      &ldquo;and we'll send over for your things to-morrow. Come&mdash;now let's go
      home to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William shook his head. He essayed a gay smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I've only just begun. I'm going to stay&mdash;oh, I don't know how
      long I'm going to stay,&rdquo; he finished blithely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy lifted her chin a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle William, you aren't playing square. Pete told us what you said when
      you left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What?&rdquo; William looked up with startled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About&mdash;about our not <i>needing</i> you. So we know, now, why you
      left; and we <i>sha'n't stand</i> it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete? That? Oh, that&mdash;that's nonsense I&mdash;I'll settle with
      Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Pete! Don't. We simply dragged it out of him. And now we're here to
      tell you that we <i>do</i> want you, and that you <i>must</i> come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again William shook his head. A swift shadow crossed his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, no, children,&rdquo; he said dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're very kind, but you don't need me. I should be just an interfering
      elder brother. I should spoil your young married life.&rdquo; (William's voice
      now sounded as if he were reciting a well-learned lesson.) &ldquo;If I went away
      and stayed two months, you'd never forget the utter freedom and joy of
      those two whole months with the house all to yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle William,&rdquo; gasped Billy, &ldquo;what <i>are</i> you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About&mdash;about my not going back, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are coming back,&rdquo; cut in Bertram, almost angrily. &ldquo;Oh, come,
      Will, this is utter nonsense, and you know it! Come, let's go home to
      dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stern look came to the corners of William's mouth&mdash;a look that
      Bertram understood well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I'll go to dinner, of course; but I sha'n't stay,&rdquo; said
      William, firmly. &ldquo;I've thought it all out. I know I'm right. Come, we'll
      go to dinner now, and say no more about it,&rdquo; he finished with a cheery
      smile, as he rose to his feet. Then, to the bride, he added: &ldquo;Did you have
      a nice trip, little girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy, too, had risen, now, but she did not seem to have heard his
      question. In the fast falling twilight her face looked a little white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle William,&rdquo; she began very quietly, &ldquo;do you think for a minute that
      just because I married your brother I am going to live in that house and
      turn you out of the home you've lived in all your life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, dear! I'm not turned out. I just go,&rdquo; corrected Uncle William,
      gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With superb disdain Billy brushed this aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you won't,&rdquo; she declared; &ldquo;but&mdash;<i>I shall</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy!&rdquo; gasped Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My&mdash;my dear!&rdquo; expostulated William, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle William! Bertram! Listen,&rdquo; panted Billy. &ldquo;I never told you much
      before, but I'm going to, now. Long ago, when I went away with Aunt
      Hannah, your sister Kate showed me how dear the old home was to you&mdash;how
      much you thought of it. And she said&mdash;she said that I had upset
      everything.&rdquo; (Bertram interjected a sharp word, but Billy paid no
      attention.) &ldquo;That's why I went; and <i>I shall go again</i>&mdash;if you
      don't come home to-morrow to stay, Uncle William. Come, now let's go to
      dinner, please. Bertram's hungry,&rdquo; she finished, with a bright smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tense moment of silence. William glanced at Bertram; Bertram
      returned the glance&mdash;with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;ah&mdash;yes; well, we might go to dinner,&rdquo; stammered William,
      after a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;yes,&rdquo; agreed Bertram. And the three fell into step together.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. &ldquo;JUST LIKE BILLY&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Billy did not leave the Strata this time. Before twenty-four hours had
      passed, the last cherished fragment of Mr. William Henshaw's possessions
      had been carefully carried down the imposing steps of the Beacon Hill
      boarding-house under the disapproving eyes of its bugle-adorned mistress,
      who found herself now with a month's advance rent and two vacant &ldquo;parlors&rdquo;
       on her hands. Before another twenty-four hours had passed her quondam
      boarder, with a tired sigh, sank into his favorite morris chair in his old
      familiar rooms, and looked about him with contented eyes. Every treasure
      was in place, from the traditional four small stones of his babyhood days
      to the Batterseas Billy had just brought him. Pete, as of yore, was
      hovering near with a dust-cloth. Bertram's gay whistle sounded from the
      floor below. William Henshaw was at home again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This much accomplished, Billy went to see Aunt Hannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah greeted her affectionately, though with tearfully troubled
      eyes. She was wearing a gray shawl to-day topped with a black one&mdash;sure
      sign of unrest, either physical or mental, as all her friends knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd begun to think you'd forgotten&mdash;me,&rdquo; she faltered, with a poor
      attempt at gayety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been home three whole days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, dearie,&rdquo; smiled Billy; &ldquo;and 'twas a shame. But I have been so
      busy! My trunks came at last, and I've been helping Uncle William get
      settled, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle William get settled? You mean&mdash;he's changed his room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed oddly, and threw a swift glance into Aunt Hannah's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, he did change,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;but he's moved back now into
      the old quarters. Er&mdash;you haven't heard from Uncle William then,
      lately, I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Aunt Hannah shook her head abstractedly. &ldquo;I did see him once,
      several weeks ago; but I haven't, since. We had quite a talk, then; and,
      Billy, I've been wanting to speak to you,&rdquo; she hurried on, a little
      feverishly. &ldquo;I didn't like to leave, of course, till you did come home, as
      long as you'd said nothing about your plans; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave!&rdquo; interposed Billy, dazedly. &ldquo;Leave where? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, leave here, of course, dear. I mean. I didn't like to get my room
      while you were away; but I shall now, of course, at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Aunt Hannah! As if I'd let you do that,&rdquo; laughed Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah stiffened perceptibly. Her lips looked suddenly thin and
      determined. Even the soft little curls above her ears seemed actually to
      bristle with resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; she began firmly, &ldquo;we might as well understand each other at
      once. I know your good heart, and I appreciate your kindness. But I can
      not come to live with you. I shall not. It wouldn't be best. I should be
      like an interfering elder brother in your home. I should spoil your young
      married life; and if I went away for two months you'd never forget the
      utter joy and freedom of those two months with the whole house ali to
      yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of this speech Billy's eyes had still carried their
      dancing smile, but as the peroration progressed on to the end, a dawning
      surprise, which soon became a puzzled questioning, drove the smile away.
      Then Billy sat suddenly erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Aunt Hannah, that's exactly what Uncle William&mdash;&rdquo; Billy
      stopped, and regarded Aunt Hannah with quick suspicion. The next moment
      she burst into gleeful laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah looked grieved, and not a little surprised; but Billy did not
      seem to notice this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, Aunt Hannah&mdash;you, too! How perfectly funny!&rdquo; she gurgled.
      &ldquo;To think you two old blesseds should get your heads together like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah stirred restively, and pulled the black shawl more closely
      about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Billy, I don't know what you mean by that,&rdquo; she sighed, with a
      visible effort at self-control; &ldquo;but I do know that I can not go to live
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your heart, dear, I don't want you to,&rdquo; soothed Billy, with gay
      promptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! O-h-h,&rdquo; stammered Aunt Hannah, surprise, mortification, dismay, and a
      grieved hurt bringing a flood of color to her face. It is one thing to
      refuse a home, and quite another to have a home refused you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! O-h-h, Aunt Hannah,&rdquo; cried Billy, turning very red in her turn.
      &ldquo;Please, <i>please</i> don't look like that. I didn't mean it that way. I
      do want you, dear, only&mdash;I want you somewhere else more. I want you&mdash;here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Aunt Hannah looked relieved, but unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Don't you like it here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it! Why, I love it, dear. You know I do. But you don't need this
      house now, Billy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I do,&rdquo; retorted Billy, airily. &ldquo;I'm going to keep it up, and I
      want you here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlededee, Billy! As if I'd let you keep up this house just for me,&rdquo;
       scorned Aunt Hannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tisn't just for you. It's for&mdash;for lots of folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grief and conscience, Billy! What are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed, and settled herself more comfortably on the hassock at Aunt
      Hannah's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll tell you. Just now I want it for Tommy Dunn, and the Greggorys
      if I can get them, and maybe one or two others. There'll always be
      somebody. You see, I had thought I'd have them at the Strata.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tommy Dunn&mdash;at the Strata!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed again ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear! You sound just like Bertram,&rdquo; she pouted. &ldquo;He didn't want Tommy,
      either, nor any of the rest of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I could have had a lot more, you know, the Strata is so big,
      especially now that Cyril has gone, and left all those empty rooms. <i>I</i>
      got real enthusiastic, but Bertram didn't. He just laughed and said
      'nonsense!' until he found I was really in earnest; then he&mdash;well, he
      said 'nonsense,' then, too&mdash;only he didn't laugh,&rdquo; finished Billy,
      with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah regarded her with fond, though slightly exasperated eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, you are, indeed, a most extraordinary young woman&mdash;at times.
      Surely, with you, a body never knows what to expect&mdash;except the
      unexpected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Aunt Hannah!&mdash;and from you, too!&rdquo; reproached Billy,
      mischievously; but Aunt Hannah had yet more to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course Bertram thought it was nonsense. The idea of you, a bride,
      filling up your house with&mdash;with people like that! Tommy Dunn,
      indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bertram said he liked Tommy all right,&rdquo; sighed Billy; &ldquo;but he said
      that that didn't mean he wanted him for three meals a day. One would think
      poor Tommy was a breakfast food! So that is when I thought of keeping up
      this house, you see, and that's why I want you here&mdash;to take charge
      of it. And you'll do that&mdash;for me, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah fell back in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, y-yes, Billy, of course, if&mdash;if you want it. But what an
      extraordinary idea, child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy shook her head. A deeper color came to her cheeks, and a softer glow
      to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so, Aunt Hannah. It's only that I'm so happy that some of
      it has just got to overflow somewhere, and this is going to be the
      overflow house&mdash;a sort of safety valve for me, you see. I'm going to
      call it the Annex&mdash;it will be an annex to our home. And I want to
      keep it full, always, of people who&mdash;who can make the best use of all
      that extra happiness that I can't possibly use myself,&rdquo; she finished a
      little tremulously. &ldquo;Don't you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I <i>see</i>,&rdquo; replied Aunt Hannah, with a fond shake of the
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, really, listen&mdash;it's sensible,&rdquo; urged Billy. &ldquo;First, there's
      Tommy. His mother died last month. He's at a neighbor's now, but they're
      going to send him to a Home for Crippled Children; and he's grieving his
      heart out over it. I'm going to bring him here to a real home&mdash;the
      kind that doesn't begin with a capital letter. He adores music, and he's
      got real talent, I think. Then there's the Greggorys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah looked dubious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't get the Greggorys to&mdash;to use any of that happiness, Billy.
      They're too proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy smiled radiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I can't get them to <i>use</i> it, Aunt Hannah, but I believe I
      can get them to <i>give</i> it,&rdquo; she declared triumphantly. &ldquo;I shall ask
      Alice Greggory to teach Tommy music, and I shall ask Mrs. Greggory to
      teach him books; and I shall tell them both that I positively need them to
      keep you company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but Billy,&rdquo; bridled Aunt Hannah, with prompt objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut!&mdash;I know you'll be willing to be thrown as a little bit of
      a sop to the Greggorys' pride,&rdquo; coaxed Billy. &ldquo;You just wait till I get
      the Overflow Annex in running order. Why, Aunt Hannah, you don't know how
      busy you're going to be handing out all that extra happiness that I can't
      use!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear child!&rdquo; Aunt Hannah smiled mistily. The black shawl had fallen
      unheeded to the floor now. &ldquo;As if anybody ever had any more happiness than
      one's self could use!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; avowed Billy, promptly, &ldquo;and it's going to keep growing and
      growing, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my grief and conscience, Billy, don't!&rdquo; exclaimed Aunt Hannah,
      lifting shocked hands of remonstrance. &ldquo;Rap on wood&mdash;do! How can you
      boast like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy dimpled roguishly and sprang to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Aunt Hannah, I'm ashamed of you! To be superstitious like that&mdash;you,
      a good Presbyterian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah subsided shamefacedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, Billy, it is silly; but I just can't help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it's worse than silly, Aunt Hannah,&rdquo; teased Billy, with a
      remorseless chuckle. &ldquo;It's really <i>heathen!</i> Bertram told me once
      that it dates 'way back to the time of the Druids&mdash;appealing to the
      god of trees, or something like that&mdash;when you rap on wood, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; shuddered Aunt Hannah. &ldquo;As if I would, Billy! How is Bertram, by
      the by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A swift shadow crossed Billy's bright face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's lovely&mdash;only his arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His arm! But I thought that was better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is,&rdquo; drooped Billy, &ldquo;but it gets along so slowly, and it frets him
      dreadfully. You know he never can do anything with his left hand, he says,
      and he just hates to have things done for him&mdash;though Pete and Dong
      Ling are quarreling with each other all the time to do things for him, and
      I'm quarreling with both of them to do them for him myself! By the way,
      Dong Ling is going to leave us next week. Did you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dong Ling&mdash;leave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Oh, he told Bertram long ago he should go when we were married; that
      he had plenty much money, and was going back to China, and not be Melican
      man any longer. But I don't think Bertram thought he'd do it. William says
      Dong Ling went to Pete, however, after we left, and told him he wanted to
      go; that he liked the little Missee plenty well, but that there'd be too
      much hen-talk when she got back, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the impudent creature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Pete was furious, William says, but Dong Ling didn't mean any
      disrespect, I'm sure. He just wasn't used to having petticoats around, and
      didn't want to take orders from them; that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Billy, what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pete's fixed all that lovely,&rdquo; returned Billy, nonchalantly. &ldquo;You
      know his niece lives over in South Boston, and it seems she's got a
      daughter who's a fine cook and will be glad to come. Mercy! Look at the
      time,&rdquo; she broke off, glancing at the clock. &ldquo;I shall be late to dinner,
      and Dong Ling loathes anybody who's late to his meals&mdash;as I found out
      to my sorrow the night we got home. Good-by, dear. I'll be out soon again
      and fix it all up&mdash;about the Annex, you know.&rdquo; And with a bright
      smile she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; sighed Aunt Hannah, stooping to pick up the black shawl; &ldquo;dear
      me! Of course everything will be all right&mdash;there's a girl coming,
      even if Dong Ling is going. But&mdash;but&mdash;Oh, my grief and
      conscience, what an extraordinary child Billy is, to be sure&mdash;but
      what a dear one!&rdquo; she added, wiping a quick tear from her eye. &ldquo;An
      Overflow Annex, indeed, for her 'extra happiness'! Now isn't that just
      like Billy?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. TIGER SKINS
    </h2>
    <p>
      September passed and October came, bringing with it cool days and clear,
      crisp evenings royally ruled over by a gorgeous harvest moon. According to
      Billy everything was just perfect&mdash;except, of course, poor Bertram's
      arm; and even the fact that that gained so slowly was not without its
      advantage (again according to Billy), for it gave Bertram more time to be
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, dear, as long as you <i>can't</i> paint,&rdquo; she told him
      earnestly, one day, &ldquo;why, I'm not really hindering you by keeping you with
      me so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly are not,&rdquo; he retorted, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may be just as happy as I like over it,&rdquo; settled Billy,
      comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if you ever could hinder me,&rdquo; he ridiculed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I could,&rdquo; nodded Billy, emphatically. &ldquo;You forget, sir. That was
      what worried me so. Everybody, even the newspapers and magazines, said I
      <i>would</i> do it, too. They said I'd slay your Art, stifle your
      Ambition, destroy your Inspiration, and be a nuisance generally. And Kate
      said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Well, never mind what Kate said,&rdquo; interrupted the man, savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed, and gave his ear a playful tweak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; but I'm not going to do it, you know&mdash;spoil your career,
      sir. You just wait,&rdquo; she continued dramatically. &ldquo;The minute your arm gets
      so you can paint, I myself shall conduct you to your studio, thrust the
      brushes into your hand, fill your palette with all the colors of the
      rainbow, and order you to paint, my lord, paint! But&mdash;until then I'm
      going to have you all I like,&rdquo; she finished, with a complete change of
      manner, nestling into the ready curve of his good left arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You witch!&rdquo; laughed the man, fondly. &ldquo;Why, Billy, you couldn't hinder me.
      You'll <i>be</i> my inspiration, dear, instead of slaying it. You'll see.
      <i>This</i> time Marguerite Winthrop's portrait is going to be a success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy turned quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are&mdash;that is, you haven't&mdash;I mean, you're going to&mdash;paint
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just am,&rdquo; avowed the artist. &ldquo;And this time it'll be a success, too,
      with you to help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy drew in her breath tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know but you'd already started it,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. After the other one failed, and Mr. Winthrop asked me to try again, I
      couldn't <i>then</i>. I was so troubled over you. That's the time you did
      hinder me,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Then came your note breaking the engagement. Of
      course I knew too much to attempt a thing like that portrait then. But now&mdash;<i>now</i>&mdash;!&rdquo;
       The pause and the emphasis were eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, <i>now</i>,&rdquo; nodded Billy, brightly, but a little feverishly.
      &ldquo;And when do you begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till January. Miss Winthrop won't be back till then. I saw J. G. last
      week, and I told him I'd accept his offer to try again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave my left hand a big grip and said: 'Good!&mdash;and you'll win out
      this time.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you will,&rdquo; nodded Billy, again, though still a little
      feverishly. &ldquo;And this time I sha'n't mind a bit if you do stay to
      luncheon, and break engagements with me, sir,&rdquo; she went on, tilting her
      chin archly, &ldquo;for I shall know it's the portrait and not the sitter that's
      really keeping you. Oh, you'll see what a fine artist's wife I'll make!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very best,&rdquo; declared Bertram so ardently that Billy blushed, and
      shook her head in reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! I wasn't fishing. I didn't mean it that way,&rdquo; she protested.
      Then, as he tried to catch her, she laughed and danced teasingly out of
      his reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Bertram could not paint, therefore, Billy had him quite to herself
      these October days; nor did she hesitate to appropriate him. Neither, on
      his part, was Bertram loath to be appropriated. Like two lovers they read
      and walked and talked together, and like two children, sometimes, they
      romped through the stately old rooms with Spunkie, or with Tommy Dunn, who
      was a frequent guest. Spunkie, be it known, was renewing her kittenhood,
      so potent was the influence of the dangling strings and rolling balls that
      she encountered everywhere; and Tommy Dunn, with Billy's help, was
      learning that not even a pair of crutches need keep a lonely little lad
      from a frolic. Even William, roused from his after-dinner doze by peals of
      laughter, was sometimes inveigled into activities that left him
      breathless, but curiously aglow. While Pete, polishing silver in the
      dining-room down-stairs, smiled indulgently at the merry clatter above&mdash;and
      forgot the teasing pain in his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not all nonsense with Billy, nor gay laughter. More often it
      was a tender glow in the eyes, a softness in the voice, a radiant
      something like an aura of joy all about her, that told how happy indeed
      were these days for her. There was proof by word of mouth, too&mdash;long
      talks with Bertram in the dancing firelight when they laid dear plans for
      the future, and when she tried so hard to make her husband understand what
      a good, good wife she intended to be, and how she meant never to let
      anything come between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so earnest and serious a Billy by this time that Bertram would turn
      startled, dismayed eyes on his young wife; whereupon, with a very
      Billy-like change of mood, she would give him one of her rare caresses,
      and perhaps sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goosey&mdash;it's only because I'm so happy, happy, happy! Why, Bertram,
      if it weren't for that Overflow Annex I believe I&mdash;I just couldn't
      live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Bertram who sighed then, and who prayed fervently in his heart that
      never might he see a real shadow cloud that dear face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, certainly, the cares of matrimony had rested anything but
      heavily upon the shapely young shoulders of the new wife. Domestic affairs
      at the Strata moved like a piece of well-oiled machinery. Dong Ling, to be
      sure, was not there; but in his place reigned Pete's grandniece, a
      fresh-faced, capable young woman who (Bertram declared) cooked like an
      angel and minded her own business like a man. Pete, as of yore, had full
      charge of the house; and a casual eye would see few changes. Even the
      brothers themselves saw few, for that matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, at the very first, Billy had donned a ruffled apron and a bewitching
      dust-cap, and had traversed the house from cellar to garret with a
      prettily important air of &ldquo;managing things,&rdquo; as she suggested changes
      right and left. She had summoned Pete, too, for three mornings in
      succession, and with great dignity had ordered the meals for the day. But
      when Bertram was discovered one evening tugging back his favorite chair,
      and when William had asked if Billy were through using his pipe-tray, the
      young wife had concluded to let things remain about as they were. And when
      William ate no breakfast one morning, and Bertram aggrievedly refused
      dessert that night at dinner, Billy&mdash;learning through an apologetic
      Pete that Master William always had to have eggs for breakfast no matter
      what else there was, and that Master Bertram never ate boiled rice&mdash;gave
      up planning the meals. True, for three more mornings she summoned Pete for
      &ldquo;orders,&rdquo; but the orders were nothing more nor less than a blithe &ldquo;Well,
      Pete, what are we going to have for dinner to-day?&rdquo; By the end of a week
      even this ceremony was given up, and before a month had passed, Billy was
      little more than a guest in her own home, so far as responsibility was
      concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy was not idle, however; far from it. First, there were the delightful
      hours with Bertram. Then there was her music: Billy was writing a new song&mdash;the
      best she had ever written, Billy declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Bertram, it can't help being that,&rdquo; she said to her husband, one
      day. &ldquo;The words just sang themselves to me right out of my heart; and the
      melody just dropped down from the sky. And now, everywhere, I'm hearing
      the most wonderful harmonies. The whole universe is singing to me. If only
      now I can put it on paper what I hear! Then I can make the whole universe
      sing to some one else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even music, however, had to step one side for the wedding calls which were
      beginning to be received, and which must be returned, in spite of the
      occasional rebellion of the young husband. There were the more intimate
      friends to be seen, also, and Cyril and Marie to be visited. And always
      there was the Annex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Annex was in fine running order now, and was a source of infinite
      satisfaction to its founder and great happiness to its beneficiaries.
      Tommy Dunn was there, learning wonderful things from books and still more
      wonderful things from the piano in the living-room. Alice Greggory and her
      mother were there, too&mdash;the result of much persuasion. Indeed,
      according to Bertram, Billy had been able to fill the Annex only by
      telling each prospective resident that he or she was absolutely necessary
      to the welfare and happiness of every other resident. Not that the house
      was full, either. There were still two unoccupied rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, I'm glad there are,&rdquo; Billy had declared, &ldquo;for there's sure to
      be some one that I'll want to send there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some <i>one</i>, did you say?&rdquo; Bertram had retorted, meaningly; but his
      wife had disdained to answer this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy herself was frequently at the Annex. She told Aunt Hannah that she
      had to come often to bring the happiness&mdash;it accumulated so fast.
      Certainly she always found plenty to do there, whenever she came. There
      was Aunt Hannah to be read to, Mrs. Greggory to be sung to, and Tommy Dunn
      to be listened to; for Tommy Dunn was always quivering with eagerness to
      play her his latest &ldquo;piece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy knew that some day at the Annex she would meet Mr. M. J. Arkwright;
      and she told herself that she hoped she should.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy had not seen Arkwright (except on the stage of the Boston Opera
      House) since the day he had left her presence in white-faced, stony-eyed
      misery after declaring his love for her, and learning of her engagement to
      Bertram. Since then, she knew, he had been much with his old friend, Alice
      Greggory. She did not believe, should she see him now, that he would be
      either white-faced, or stony-eyed. His heart, she was sure, had gone where
      it ought to have gone in the first place&mdash;to Alice. Such being, in
      her opinion, the case, she longed to get the embarrassment of a first
      meeting between themselves over with, for, after that, she was sure, their
      old friendship could be renewed, and she would be in a position to further
      this pretty love affair between him and Alice. Very decidedly, therefore,
      Billy wished to meet Arkwright. Very pleased, consequently, was she when,
      one day, coming into the living-room at the Annex, she found the man
      sitting by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright was on his feet at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss&mdash;Mrs. H&mdash;Henshaw,&rdquo; he stammered
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Arkwright,&rdquo; she cried, with just a shade of nervousness in her
      voice as she advanced, her hand outstretched. &ldquo;I'm glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I wanted to see Miss Greggory,&rdquo; he murmured. Then, as the
      unconscious rudeness of his reply dawned on him, he made matters
      infinitely worse by an attempted apology. &ldquo;That is, I mean&mdash;I didn't
      mean&mdash;&rdquo; he began to stammer miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some girls might have tossed the floundering man a straw in the shape of a
      light laugh intended to turn aside all embarrassment&mdash;but not Billy.
      Billy held out a frankly helping hand that was meant to set the man
      squarely on his feet at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arkwright, don't, please,&rdquo; she begged earnestly. &ldquo;You and I don't
      need to beat about the bush. I <i>am</i> glad to see you, and I hope
      you're glad to see me. We're going to be the best of friends from now on,
      I'm sure; and some day, soon, you're going to bring Alice to see me, and
      we'll have some music. I left her up-stairs. She'll be down at once, I
      dare say&mdash;I met Rosa going up with your card. Good-by,&rdquo; she finished
      with a bright smile, as she turned and walked rapidly from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, on the steps, Billy drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;that's over&mdash;and well over!&rdquo; The next minute
      she frowned vexedly. She had missed her glove. &ldquo;Never mind! I sha'n't go
      back in there for it now, anyway,&rdquo; she decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the living-room, five minutes later, Alice Greggory found only a
      hastily scrawled note waiting for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'll forgive the unforgivable,&rdquo; she read &ldquo;you'll forgive me for not
      being here when you come down. 'Circumstances over which I have no control
      have called me away.' May we let it go at that?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. J. ARKWRIGHT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Alice Greggory's amazed, questioning eyes left the note they fell upon
      the long white glove on the floor by the door. Half mechanically she
      crossed the room and picked it up; but almost at once she dropped it with
      a low cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy! He&mdash;saw&mdash;Billy!&rdquo; Then a flood of understanding dyed her
      face scarlet as she turned and fled to the blessedly unseeing walls of her
      own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not ten minutes later Rosa tapped at her door with a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's from Mr. Arkwright, Miss. He's downstairs.&rdquo; Rosa's eyes were
      puzzled, and a bit startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arkwright!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss. He's come again. That is, I didn't know he'd went&mdash;but he
      must have, for he's come again now. He wrote something in a little book;
      then he tore it out and gave it to me. He said he'd wait, please, for an
      answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well, Rosa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Greggory took the note and spoke with an elaborate air of
      indifference that was meant to express a calm ignoring of the puzzled
      questioning in the other's eyes. The next moment she read this in
      Arkwright's peculiar scrawl:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you've already forgiven the unforgivable, you'll do it again, I know,
      and come down-stairs. Won't you, please? I want to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Greggory lifted her head with a jerk. Her face was a painful red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Mr. Arkwright I can't possibly&mdash;&rdquo; She came to an abrupt pause.
      Her eyes had encountered Rosa's, and in Rosa's eyes the puzzled
      questioning was plainly fast becoming a shrewd suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the briefest of hesitations; then, lightly, Miss Greggory tossed
      the note aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Mr. Arkwright I'll be down at once, please,&rdquo; she directed
      carelessly, as she turned back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was not down at once. She was not down until she had taken time to
      bathe her red eyes, powder her telltale nose, smoothe her ruffled hair,
      and whip herself into the calm, steady-eyed, self-controlled young woman
      that Arkwright finally rose to meet when she came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was only women who were privileged to change their mind,&rdquo;
       she began brightly; but Arkwright ignored her attempt to conventionalize
      the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for coming down,&rdquo; he said, with a weariness that instantly
      drove the forced smile from the girl's lips. &ldquo;I&mdash;I wanted to&mdash;to
      talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; She seated herself and motioned him to a chair near her. He took
      the seat, and then fell silent, his eyes out the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you said you&mdash;you wanted to talk, she reminded him
      nervously, after a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo; He turned with disconcerting abruptness. &ldquo;Alice, I'm going to
      tell you a story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad to listen. People always like stories, don't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they?&rdquo; The somber pain in Arkwright's eyes deepened. Alice Greggory
      did not know it, but he was thinking of another story he had once told in
      that same room. Billy was his listener then, while now&mdash;A little
      precipitately he began to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was a very small boy I went to visit my uncle, who, in his young
      days, had been quite a hunter. Before the fireplace in his library was a
      huge tiger skin with a particularly lifelike head. The first time I saw it
      I screamed, and ran and hid. I refused then even to go into the room
      again. My cousins urged, scolded, pleaded, and laughed at me by turns, but
      I was obdurate. I would not go where I could see the fearsome thing again,
      even though it was, as they said, 'nothing but a dead old rug!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally, one day, my uncle took a hand in the matter. By sheer will-power
      he forced me to go with him straight up to the dreaded creature, and stand
      by its side. He laid one of my shrinking hands on the beast's smooth head,
      and thrust the other one quite into the open red mouth with its gleaming
      teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You see,' he said, 'there's absolutely nothing to fear. He can't
      possibly hurt you. Just as if you weren't bigger and finer and stronger in
      every way than that dead thing on the floor!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, when he had got me to the point where of my own free will I would
      walk up and touch the thing, he drew a lesson for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now remember,' he charged me. 'Never run and hide again. Only cowards do
      that. Walk straight up and face the thing. Ten to one you'll find it's
      nothing but a dead skin masquerading as the real thing. Even if it isn't
      if it's alive&mdash;face it. Find a weapon and fight it. Know that you are
      going to conquer it and you'll conquer. Never run. Be a man. Men don't
      run, my boy!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright paused, and drew a long breath. He did not look at the girl in
      the opposite chair. If he had looked he would have seen a face
      transfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;I never forgot that tiger skin, nor what it stood
      for, after that day when Uncle Ben thrust my hand into its hideous, but
      harmless, red mouth. Even as a kid I began, then, to try&mdash;not to run.
      I've tried ever since But to-day&mdash;I did run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright's voice had been getting lower and lower. The last three words
      would have been almost inaudible to ears less sensitively alert than were
      Alice Greggory's. For a moment after the words were uttered, only the
      clock's ticking broke the silence; then, with an obvious effort, the man
      roused himself, as if breaking away from some benumbing force that held
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice, I don't need to tell you, after what I said the other night, that
      I loved Billy Neilson. That was bad enough, for I found she was pledged to
      another man. But to-day I discovered something worse: I discovered that I
      loved Billy <i>Henshaw</i>&mdash;another man's wife. And&mdash;I ran. But
      I've come back. I'm going to face the thing. Oh, I'm not deceiving myself!
      This love of mine is no dead tiger skin. It's a beast, alive and alert&mdash;God
      pity me!&mdash;to destroy my very soul. But I'm going to fight it; and&mdash;I
      want you to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave a half-smothered cry. The man turned, but he could not see
      her face distinctly. Twilight had come, and the room was full of shadows.
      He hesitated, then went on, a little more quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why I've told you all this&mdash;so you would help me. And you
      will, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. Once again he tried to see her face, but it was
      turned now quite away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been a big help already, little girl. Your friendship, your
      comradeship&mdash;they've been everything to me. You're not going to make
      me do without them&mdash;now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;oh, no!&rdquo; The answer was low and a little breathless; but he
      heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I knew you wouldn't.&rdquo; He paused, then rose to his feet. When
      he spoke again his voice carried a note of whimsical lightness that was a
      little forced. &ldquo;But I must go&mdash;else you <i>will</i> take them from
      me, and with good reason. And please don't let your kind heart grieve too
      much&mdash;over me. I'm no deep-dyed villain in a melodrama, nor wicked
      lover in a ten-penny novel, you know. I'm just an everyday man in real
      life; and we're going to fight this thing out in everyday living. That's
      where your help is coming in. We'll go together to see Mrs. Bertram
      Henshaw. She's asked us to, and you'll do it, I know. We'll have music and
      everyday talk. We'll see Mrs. Bertram Henshaw in her own home with her
      husband, where she belongs; and&mdash;I'm not going to run again. But&mdash;I'm
      counting on your help, you know,&rdquo; he smiled a little wistfully, as he held
      out his hand in good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      One minute later Alice Greggory, alone, was hurrying up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't&mdash;I can't&mdash;I know I can't,&rdquo; she was whispering wildly.
      Then, in her own room, she faced herself in the mirror. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you&mdash;can,
      Alice Greggory,&rdquo; she asserted, with swift change of voice and manner.
      &ldquo;This is <i>your</i> tiger skin, and you're going to fight it. Do you
      understand?&mdash;fight it! And you're going to win, too. Do you want that
      man to know you&mdash;<i>care</i>?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. &ldquo;THE PAINTING LOOK&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      It was toward the last of October that Billy began to notice her husband's
      growing restlessness. Twice, when she had been playing to him, she turned
      to find him testing the suppleness of his injured arm. Several times,
      failing to receive an answer to her questions, she had looked up to
      discover him gazing abstractedly at nothing in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      They read and walked and talked together, to be sure, and Bertram's
      devotion to her lightest wish was beyond question; but more and more
      frequently these days Billy found him hovering over his sketches in his
      studio; and once, when he failed to respond to the dinner-bell, search
      revealed him buried in a profound treatise on &ldquo;The Art of Foreshortening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came the day when Billy, after an hour's vain effort to imprison
      within notes a tantalizing melody, captured the truant and rain down to
      the studio to tell Bertram of her victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bertram did not seem even to hear her. True, he leaped to his feet and
      hurried to meet her, his face radiantly aglow; but she had not ceased to
      speak before he himself was talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, Billy, I've been sketching,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;My hand is almost steady.
      See, some of those lines are all right! I just picked up a crayon and&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stopped abruptly, his eyes on Billy's face. A vaguely troubled shadow
      crossed his own. &ldquo;Did&mdash;did you&mdash;were you saying anything in&mdash;in
      particular, when you came in?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a short half-minute Billy looked at her husband without speaking.
      Then, a little queerly, she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, nothing at all in <i>particular</i>,&rdquo; she retorted airily. The
      next moment, with one of her unexpected changes of manner, she darted
      across the room, picked up a palette, and a handful of brushes from the
      long box near it. Advancing toward her husband she held them out
      dramatically. &ldquo;And now paint, my lord, paint!&rdquo; she commanded him, with
      stern insistence, as she thrust them into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram laughed shamefacedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, Billy,&rdquo; he began; but Billy had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the hall Billy was speeding up-stairs, talking fiercely to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll, Billy Neilson Henshaw, it's come! Now behave yourself. <i>That was
      the painting look!</i> You know what that means. Remember, he belongs to
      his Art before he does to you. Kate and everybody says so. And you&mdash;you
      expected him to tend to you and your silly little songs. Do you want to
      ruin his career? As if now he could spend all his time and give all his
      thoughts to you! But I&mdash;I just hate that Art!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say, Billy?&rdquo; asked William, in mild surprise, coming around
      the turn of the balustrade in the hall above. &ldquo;Were you speaking to me, my
      dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy looked up. Her face cleared suddenly, and she laughed&mdash;though a
      little ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Uncle William, I wasn't talking to you,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I was just&mdash;just
      administering first aid to the injured,&rdquo; she finished, as she whisked into
      her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, bless the child! What can she mean by that?&rdquo; puzzled Uncle
      William, turning to go down the stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram began to paint a very little the next day. He painted still more
      the next, and yet more again the day following. He was like a bird let out
      of a cage, so joyously alive was he. The old sparkle came back to his eye,
      the old gay smile to his lips. Now that they had come back Billy realized
      what she had not been conscious of before: that for several weeks past
      they had not been there; and she wondered which hurt the more&mdash;that
      they had not been there before, or that they were there now. Then she
      scolded herself roundly for asking the question at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not easy&mdash;those days for Billy, though always to Bertram
      she managed to show a cheerfully serene face. To Uncle William, also, and
      to Aunt Hannah she showed a smiling countenance; and because she could not
      talk to anybody else of her feelings, she talked to herself. This,
      however, was no new thing for Billy to do From earliest childhood she had
      fought things out in like manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's so absurd of you, Billy Henshaw,&rdquo; she berated herself one day,
      when Bertram had become so absorbed in his work that he had forgotten to
      keep his appointment with her for a walk. &ldquo;Just because you have had his
      constant attention almost every hour since you were married is no reason
      why you should have it every hour now, when his arm is better! Besides,
      it's exactly what you said you wouldn't do&mdash;object&mdash;to his
      giving proper time to his work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm not objecting,&rdquo; stormed the other half of herself. &ldquo;I'm <i>telling</i>
      him to do it. It's only that he's so&mdash;so <i>pleased</i> to do it. He
      doesn't seem to mind a bit being away from me. He's actually happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't you want him to be happy in his work? Fie! For shame! A fine
      artist's wife you are. It seems Kate was right, then; you <i>are</i> going
      to spoil his career!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; quoth Billy, and tossed her head. Forthwith she crossed the room to
      her piano and plumped herself down hard on to the stool. Then, from under
      her fingers there fell a rollicking melody that seemed to fill the room
      with little dancing feet. Faster and faster sped Billy's fingers; swifter
      and swifter twinkled the little dancing feet. Then a door was jerked open,
      and Bertram's voice called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The music stopped instantly. Billy sprang from her seat, her eyes eagerly
      seeking the direction from which had come the voice. Perhaps&mdash;<i>perhaps</i>
      Bertram wanted her. Perhaps he was not going to paint any longer that
      morning, after all. &ldquo;Billy!&rdquo; called the voice again. &ldquo;Please, do you mind
      stopping that playing just for a little while? I'm a brute, I know, dear,
      but my brush <i>will</i> try to keep time with that crazy little tune of
      yours, and you know my hand is none too steady, anyhow, and when it tries
      to keep up with that jiggety, jig, jig, jiggety, jig, jig&mdash;! <i>Do</i>
      you mind, darling, just&mdash;just sewing, or doing something still for a
      while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the light fled from Billy's face, but her voice, when she spoke, was
      the quintessence of cheery indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, of course not, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I knew you wouldn't,&rdquo; sighed Bertram. Then the door shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long minute Billy stood motionless before she glanced at her watch
      and sped to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Miss Greggory there, Rosa?&rdquo; she called when the operator's ring was
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mis' Greggory, the lame one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; <i>Miss</i> Greggory&mdash;Miss Alice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then won't you ask her to come to the telephone, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's wait, during which Billy's small, well-shod foot beat
      a nervous tattoo on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that you, Alice?&rdquo; she called then. &ldquo;Are you going to be home for
      an hour or two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, y-yes; yes, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'm coming over. We'll play duets, sing&mdash;anything. I want some
      music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do! And&mdash;Mr. Arkwright is here. He'll help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arkwright? You say he's there? Then I won't&mdash;Yes, I will, too.&rdquo;
       Billy spoke with renewed firmness. &ldquo;I'll be there right away. Good-by.&rdquo;
       And she hung up the receiver, and went to tell Pete to order John and
      Peggy at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I ought to have left Alice and Mr. Arkwright alone together,&rdquo;
       muttered the young wife feverishly, as she hurriedly prepared for
      departure. &ldquo;But I'll make it up to them later. I'm going to give them lots
      of chances. But to-day&mdash;to-day I just had to go&mdash;somewhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the Annex, with Alice Greggory and Arkwright, Billy sang duets and
      trios, and reveled in a sonorous wilderness of new music to her heart's
      content. Then, rested, refreshed, and at peace with all the world, she
      hurried home to dinner and to Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! I feel better,&rdquo; she sighed, as she took off her hat in her own
      room; &ldquo;and now I'll go find Bertram. Bless his heart&mdash;of course he
      didn't want me to play when he was so busy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy went straight to the studio, but Bertram was not there. Neither was
      he in William's room, nor anywhere in the house. Down-stairs in the
      dining-room Pete was found looking rather white, leaning back in a chair.
      He struggled at once to his feet, however, as his mistress entered the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy hurried forward with a startled exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Pete, what is it? Are you sick?&rdquo; she cried, her glance encompassing
      the half-set table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am; oh, no, ma'am!&rdquo; The old man stumbled forward and began to
      arrange the knives and forks. &ldquo;It's just a pesky pain&mdash;beggin' yer
      pardon&mdash;in my side. But I ain't sick. No, Miss&mdash;ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy frowned and shook her head. Her eyes were on Pete's palpably
      trembling hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Pete, you are sick,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Let Eliza do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete drew himself stiffly erect. The color had begun to come back to his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There hain't no one set this table much but me for more'n fifty years,
      an' I've got a sort of notion that nobody can do it just ter suit me.
      Besides, I'm better now. It's gone&mdash;that pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Pete, what is it? How long have you had it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't had it any time, steady. It's the comin' an' goin' kind. It
      seems silly ter mind it at all; only, when it does come, it sort o' takes
      the backbone right out o' my knees, and they double up so's I have ter set
      down. There, ye see? I'm pert as a sparrer, now!&rdquo; And, with stiff
      celerity, Pete resumed his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mistress still frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't right, Pete,&rdquo; she demurred, with a slow shake of her head.
      &ldquo;You should see a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man paled a little. He had seen a doctor, and he had not liked
      what the doctor had told him. In fact, he stubbornly refused to believe
      what the doctor had said. He straightened himself now a little
      aggressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Beggin' yer pardon, Miss&mdash;ma'am, but I don't think much o'
      them doctor chaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy shook her head again as she smiled and turned away. Then, as if
      casually, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did Mr. Bertram go out, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss; about five o'clock. He said he'd be back to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the hall the telephone jangled sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go,&rdquo; said Pete's mistress, as she turned and hurried up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Bertram's voice that answered her opening &ldquo;Hullo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Billy, is that you, dear? Well, you're just the one I wanted. I
      wanted to say&mdash;that is, I wanted to ask you&mdash;&rdquo; The speaker
      cleared his throat a little nervously, and began all over again. &ldquo;The fact
      is, Billy, I've run across a couple of old classmates on from New York,
      and they are very anxious I should stay down to dinner with them. Would
      you mind&mdash;very much if I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cold hand seemed to clutch Billy's heart. She caught her breath with a
      little gasp and tried to speak; but she had to try twice before the words
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no&mdash;no, of course not!&rdquo; Billy's voice was very high-pitched and
      a little shaky, but it was surpassingly cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sure you won't be&mdash;lonesome?&rdquo; Bertram's voice was vaguely
      troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've only to say the word, little girl,&rdquo; came Bertram's anxious tones
      again, &ldquo;and I won't stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy swallowed convulsively. If only, only he would <i>stop</i> and leave
      her to herself! As if she were going to own up that <i>she</i> was
      lonesome for <i>him</i>&mdash;if <i>he</i> was not lonesome for <i>her!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! of course you'll stay,&rdquo; called Billy, still in that
      high-pitched, shaky treble. Then, before Bertram could answer, she uttered
      a gay &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; and hung up the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy had ten whole minutes in which to cry before Pete's gong sounded for
      dinner; but she had only one minute in which to try to efface the woefully
      visible effects of those ten minutes before William tapped at her door,
      and called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to sleep, my dear? Dinner's ready. Didn't you hear the gong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm coming, Uncle William.&rdquo; Billy spoke with breezy gayety, and
      threw open the door; but she did not meet Uncle William's eyes. Her head
      was turned away. Her hands were fussing with the hang of her skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram's dining out, Pete tells me,&rdquo; observed William, with cheerful
      nonchalance, as they went down-stairs together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy bit her lip and looked up sharply. She had been bracing herself to
      meet with disdainful indifference this man's pity&mdash;the pity due a
      poor neglected wife whose husband <i>preferred</i> to dine with old
      classmates rather than with herself. Now she found in William's face, not
      pity, but a calm, even jovial, acceptance of the situation as a matter of
      course. She had known she was going to hate that pity; but now, curiously
      enough, she was conscious only of anger that the pity was not there&mdash;that
      she might hate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tossed her head a little. So even William&mdash;Uncle William&mdash;regarded
      this monstrous thing as an insignificant matter of everyday experience.
      Maybe he expected it to occur frequently&mdash;every night, or so.
      Doubtless he did expect it to occur every night, or so. Indeed! Very well.
      As if she were going to show <i>now</i> that she cared whether Bertram
      were there or not! They should see.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with head held high and eyes asparkle, Billy marched into the
      dining-room and took her accustomed place.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE BIG BAD QUARREL
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a brilliant dinner&mdash;because Billy made it so. At first William
      met her sallies of wit with mild surprise; but it was not long before he
      rose gallantly to the occasion, and gave back full measure of retort. Even
      Pete twice had to turn his back to hide a smile, and once his hand shook
      so that the tea he was carrying almost spilled. This threatened
      catastrophe, however, seemed to frighten him so much that his face was
      very grave throughout the rest of the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still laughing and talking gayly, Billy and Uncle William, after the meal
      was over, ascended to the drawing-room. There, however, the man, in spite
      of the young woman's gay badinage, fell to dozing in the big chair before
      the fire, leaving Billy with only Spunkie for company&mdash;Spunkie, who,
      disdaining every effort to entice her into a romp, only winked and blinked
      stupid eyes, and finally curled herself on the rug for a nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, left to her own devices, glanced at her watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past seven! Time, almost, for Bertram to be coming. He had said
      &ldquo;dinner&rdquo;; and, of course, after dinner was over he would be coming home&mdash;to
      her. Very well; she would show him that she had at least got along without
      him as well as he had without her. At all events he would not find her
      forlornly sitting with her nose pressed against the window-pane! And
      forthwith Billy established herself in a big chair (with its back
      carefully turned toward the door by which Bertram would enter), and opened
      a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed. Billy fidgeted in her chair, twisted
      her neck to look out into the hall&mdash;and dropped her book with a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle William jerked himself awake, and Spunkie opened sleepy eyes. Then
      both settled themselves for another nap. Billy sighed, picked up her book,
      and flounced back into her chair. But she did not read. Disconsolately she
      sat staring straight ahead&mdash;until a quick step on the sidewalk
      outside stirred her into instant action. Assuming a look of absorbed
      interest she twitched the book open and held it before her face.... But
      the step passed by the door: and Billy saw then that her book was upside
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five, ten, fifteen more minutes passed. Billy still sat, apparently
      reading, though she had not turned a page. The book now, however, was
      right side up. One by one other minutes passed till the great clock in the
      hall struck nine long strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, bless my soul!&rdquo; mumbled Uncle William, resolutely forcing
      himself to wake up. &ldquo;What time was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine o'clock.&rdquo; Billy spoke with tragic distinctness, yet very cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Only nine?&rdquo; blinked Uncle William. &ldquo;I thought it must be ten. Well,
      anyhow, I believe I'll go up-stairs. I seem to be unusually sleepy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy said nothing. &ldquo;'Only nine,' indeed!&rdquo; she was thinking wrathfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door Uncle William turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not going to sit up, my dear, of course,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second time that evening a cold hand seemed to clutch Billy's
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sit up!</i> Had it come already to that? Was she even now a wife who
      had need to <i>sit up</i> for her husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really wouldn't, my dear,&rdquo; advised Uncle William again. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I'm not sleepy at all, yet,&rdquo; Billy managed to declare brightly.
      &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Uncle William went up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy turned to her book, which happened to be one of William's on &ldquo;Fake
      Antiques.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'To collect anything, these days, requires expert knowledge, and the
      utmost care and discrimination,'&rdquo; read Billy's eyes. &ldquo;So Uncle William <i>expected</i>
      Bertram was going to spend the whole evening as well as stay to dinner!&rdquo;
       ran Billy's thoughts. &ldquo;'The enormous quantity of bijouterie, Dresden and
      Battersea enamel ware that is now flooding the market, is made on the
      Continent&mdash;and made chiefly for the American trade,'&rdquo; continued the
      book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who cares if it is,&rdquo; snapped Billy, springing to her feet and
      tossing the volume aside. &ldquo;Spunkie, come here! You've simply got to play
      with me. Do you hear? I want to be gay&mdash;<i>gay</i>&mdash;GAY! He's
      gay. He's down there with those men, where he wants to be. Where he'd <i>rather</i>
      be than be with me! Do you think I want him to come home and find me
      moping over a stupid old book? Not much! I'm going to have him find me
      gay, too. Now, come, Spunkie; hurry&mdash;wake up! He'll be here right
      away, I'm sure.&rdquo; And Billy shook a pair of worsted reins, hung with little
      soft balls, full in Spunkie's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Spunkie would not wake up, and Spunkie would not play. She pretended
      to. She bit at the reins, and sank her sharp claws into the dangling
      balls. For a fleeting instant, even, something like mischief gleamed in
      her big yellow eyes. Then the jaws relaxed, the paws turned to velvet, and
      Spunkie's sleek gray head settled slowly back into lazy comfort. Spunkie
      was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy gazed at the cat with reproachful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, too, Spunkie,&rdquo; she murmured. Then she got to her feet and went
      back to her chair. This time she picked up a magazine and began to turn
      the leaves very fast, one after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past nine came, then ten. Pete appeared at the door to get Spunkie,
      and to see that everything was all right for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bertram is not in yet?&rdquo; he began doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy shook her head with a bright smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Pete. Go to bed. I expect him every minute. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, ma'am. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man picked up the sleepy cat and went down-stairs. A little later
      Billy heard his quiet steps coming back through the hall and ascending the
      stairs. She listened until from away at the top of the house she heard his
      door close. Then she drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten o'clock&mdash;after ten o'clock, and Bertram not there yet! And was
      this what he called dinner? Did one eat, then, till ten o'clock, when one
      dined with one's friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy was angry now&mdash;very angry. She was too angry to be reasonable.
      This thing that her husband had done seemed monstrous to her, smarting, as
      she was, under the sting of hurt pride and grieved loneliness&mdash;the
      state of mind into which she had worked herself. No longer now did she
      wish to be gay when her husband came. No longer did she even pretend to
      assume indifference. Bertram had done wrong. He had been unkind, cruel,
      thoughtless, inconsiderate of her comfort and happiness. Furthermore he <i>did
      not</i> love her as well as she did him or he never, never could have done
      it! She would let him see, when he came, just how hurt and grieved she was&mdash;and
      how disappointed, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy was walking the floor now, back and forth, back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past ten came, then eleven. As the eleven long strokes reverberated
      through the silent house Billy drew in her breath and held it suspended. A
      new look came to her eyes. A growing terror crept into them and culminated
      in a frightened stare at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy ran then to the great outer door and pulled it open. A cold wind
      stung her face, and caused her to shut the door quickly. Back and forth
      she began to pace the floor again; but in five minutes she had run to the
      door once more. This time she wore a heavy coat of Bertram's which she
      caught up as she passed the hall-rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out on to the broad top step Billy hurried, and peered down the street. As
      far as she could see not a person was in sight. Across the street in the
      Public Garden the wind stirred the gray tree-branches and set them to
      casting weird shadows on the bare, frozen ground. A warning something
      behind her sent Billy scurrying into the house just in time to prevent the
      heavy door's closing and shutting her out, keyless, in the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past eleven came, and again Billy ran to the door. This time she put
      the floor-mat against the casing so that the door could not close. Once
      more she peered wildly up and down the street, and across into the
      deserted, wind-swept Garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only terror now in Billy's face. The anger was all gone. In
      Billy's mind there was not a shadow of doubt&mdash;something had happened
      to Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram was ill&mdash;hurt&mdash;dead! And he was so good, so kind, so
      noble; such a dear, dear husband! If only she could see him once. If only
      she could ask his forgiveness for those wicked, unkind, accusing thoughts.
      If only she could tell him again that she did love him. If only&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Far down the street a step rang sharply on the frosty air. A masculine
      figure was hurrying toward the house. Retreating well into the shadow of
      the doorway, Billy watched it, her heart pounding against her side in
      great suffocating throbs. Nearer and nearer strode the approaching figure
      until Billy had almost sprung to meet it with a glad cry&mdash;almost, but
      not quite; for the figure neither turned nor paused, but marched straight
      on&mdash;and Billy saw then, under the arc light, a brown-bearded man who
      was not Bertram at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three times during the next few minutes did the waiting little bride on
      the doorstep watch with palpitating yearning a shadowy form appear,
      approach&mdash;and pass by. At the third heart-breaking disappointment,
      Billy wrung her hands helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how there can be&mdash;so many&mdash;utterly <i>useless</i>
      people in the world!&rdquo; she choked. Then, thoroughly chilled and sick at
      heart, she went into the house and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, back and forth, back and forth, Billy took up her weary vigil.
      She still wore the heavy coat. She had forgotten to take it off. Her face
      was pitifully white and drawn. Her eyes were wild. One of her hands was
      nervously caressing the rough sleeve of the coat as it hung from her
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy gave a sharp cry and ran into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was twelve o'clock. And now, always, all the rest of the dreary,
      useless hours that that clock would tick away through an endless
      existence, she would have to live&mdash;without Bertram. If only she could
      see him once more! But she could not. He was dead. He must be dead, now.
      Here it was twelve o'clock, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a quick step, the click of a key in the lock, then the door
      swung back and Bertram, big, strong, and merry-eyed, stood before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, hullo,&rdquo; he called jovially. &ldquo;Why, Billy, what's the matter?&rdquo;
       he broke off, in quite a different tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then a curious thing happened. Billy, who, a minute before, had been
      seeing only a dear, noble, adorable, <i>lost</i> Bertram, saw now suddenly
      only the man that had stayed <i>happily</i> till midnight with two
      friends, while she&mdash;she&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter! Matter!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy sharply, then. &ldquo;Is this what you call
      staying to dinner, Bertram Henshaw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram stared. A slow red stole to his forehead. It was his first
      experience of coming home to meet angry eyes that questioned his behavior&mdash;and
      he did not like it. He had been, perhaps, a little conscience-smitten when
      he saw how late he had stayed; and he had intended to say he was sorry, of
      course. But to be thus sharply called to account for a perfectly innocent
      good time with a couple of friends&mdash;! To come home and find Billy
      making a ridiculous scene like this&mdash;! He&mdash;he would not stand
      for it! He&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram's lips snapped open. The angry retort was almost spoken when
      something in the piteously quivering chin and white, drawn face opposite
      stopped it just in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Billy&mdash;darling!&rdquo; he murmured instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Billy's turn to change. All the anger melted away before the
      dismayed tenderness in those dear eyes and the grieved hurt in that dear
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&mdash;you&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Billy began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all right then, of course, for the next minute she was crying on
      Bertram's big, broad shoulder; and in the midst of broken words, kisses,
      gentle pats, and inarticulate croonings, the Big, Bad Quarrel, that had
      been all ready to materialize, faded quite away into nothingness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't have such an awfully good time, anyhow,&rdquo; avowed Bertram, when
      speech became rational. &ldquo;I'd rather have been home with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; blinked Billy, valiantly. &ldquo;Of course you had a good time; and
      it was perfectly right you should have it, too! And I&mdash;I hope you'll
      have it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sha'n't,&rdquo; emphasized Bertram, promptly, &ldquo;&mdash;not and leave you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy regarded him with adoring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you; we'll have 'em come here,&rdquo; she proposed gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure we will,&rdquo; agreed Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; sure we will,&rdquo; echoed Billy, with a contented sigh. Then, a little
      breathlessly, she added: &ldquo;Anyhow, I'll know&mdash;where you are. I won't
      think you're&mdash;dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;blessed&mdash;little-goose!&rdquo; scolded Bertram, punctuating each
      word with a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy drew a long sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this is a quarrel I'm going to have them often,&rdquo; she announced
      placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy!&rdquo; The young husband was plainly aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am&mdash;because I like the making-up,&rdquo; dimpled Billy, with a
      mischievous twinkle as she broke from his clasp and skipped ahead up the
      stairway.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. BILLY CULTIVATES A &ldquo;COMFORTABLE INDIFFERENCE&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning, under the uncompromising challenge of a bright sun,
      Billy began to be uneasily suspicious that she had been just a bit
      unreasonable and exacting the night before. To make matters worse she
      chanced to run across a newspaper criticism of a new book bearing the
      ominous title: &ldquo;When the Honeymoon Wanes A Talk to Young Wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such a title, of course, attracted her supersensitive attention at once;
      and, with a curiously faint feeling, she picked up the paper and began to
      read.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the most of the criticism was taken up with quotations from the book,
      it was such sentences as these that met her startled eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the first test comes when the young wife awakes to the
      realization that while her husband loves her very much, he can still make
      plans with his old friends which do not include herself.... Then is when
      the foolish wife lets her husband see how hurt she is that he can want to
      be with any one but herself.... Then is when the husband&mdash;used all
      his life to independence, perhaps&mdash;begins to chafe under these new
      bonds that hold him so fast.... No man likes to be held up at the end of a
      threatened scene and made to give an account of himself.... Before a woman
      has learned to cultivate a comfortable indifference to her husband's
      comings and goings, she is apt to be tyrannical and exacting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Comfortable indifference,' indeed!&rdquo; stormed Billy to herself. &ldquo;As if I
      ever could be comfortably indifferent to anything Bertram did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped the paper; but there were still other quotations from the book
      there, she knew; and in a moment she was back at the table reading them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No man, however fondly he loves his wife, likes to feel that she is
      everlastingly peering into the recesses of his mind, and weighing his
      every act to find out if he does or does not love her to-day as well as he
      did yesterday at this time.... Then, when spontaneity is dead, she is the
      chief mourner at its funeral.... A few couples never leave the Garden of
      Eden. They grow old hand in hand. They are the ones who bear and forbear;
      who have learned to adjust themselves to the intimate relationship of
      living together.... A certain amount of liberty, both of action and
      thought, must be allowed on each side.... The family shut in upon itself
      grows so narrow that all interest in the outside world is lost.... No two
      people are ever fitted to fill each other's lives entirely. They ought not
      to try to do it. If they do try, the process is belittling to each, and
      the result, if it is successful, is nothing less than a tragedy; for it
      could not mean the highest ideals, nor the truest devotion.... Brushing up
      against other interests and other personalities is good for both husband
      and wife. Then to each other they bring the best of what they have found,
      and each to the other continues to be new and interesting.... The young
      wife, however, is apt to be jealous of everything that turns her husband's
      attention for one moment away from herself. She is jealous of his
      thoughts, his words, his friends, even his business.... But the wife who
      has learned to be the clinging vine when her husband wishes her to cling,
      and to be the sturdy oak when clinging vines would be tiresome, has solved
      a tremendous problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point Billy dropped the paper. She flung it down, indeed, a bit
      angrily. There were still a few more words in the criticism, mostly the
      critic's own opinion of the book; but Billy did not care for this. She had
      read quite enough&mdash;boo much, in fact. All that sort of talk might be
      very well, even necessary, perhaps (she told herself), for ordinary
      husbands and wives! but for her and Bertram&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then vividly before her rose those initial quoted words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the first test comes when the young wife awakes to the
      realization that while her husband loves her very much, he can still make
      plans with his old friends which do not include herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy frowned, and put her finger to her lips. Was that then, last night,
      a &ldquo;test&rdquo;? Had she been &ldquo;tyrannical and exacting&rdquo;? Was she &ldquo;everlastingly
      peering into the recesses&rdquo; of Bertram's mind and &ldquo;weighing his every act&rdquo;?
      Was Bertram already beginning to &ldquo;chafe&rdquo; under these new bonds that held
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, never that! She could not believe that. But what if he should
      sometime begin to chafe? What if they two should, in days to come,
      degenerate into just the ordinary, everyday married folk, whom she saw
      about her everywhere, and for whom just such horrid books as this must be
      written? It was unbelievable, unthinkable. And yet, that man had said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a despairing sigh Billy picked up the paper once more and read
      carefully every word again. When she had finished she stood soberly
      thoughtful, her eyes out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, it was nothing but the same old story. She was exacting. She
      did want her husband's every thought. She <i>gloried</i> in peering into
      every last recess of his mind if she had half a chance. She was jealous of
      his work. She had almost hated his painting&mdash;at times. She had held
      him up with a threatened scene only the night before and demanded that he
      should give an account of himself. She had, very likely, been the clinging
      vine when she should have been the sturdy oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well, then. (Billy lifted her head and threw back her shoulders.) He
      should have no further cause for complaint. She would be an oak. She would
      cultivate that comfortable indifference to his comings and goings. She
      would brush up against other interests and personalities so as to be &ldquo;new&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; to her husband. She would not be tyrannical, exacting,
      or jealous. She would not threaten scenes, nor peer into recesses.
      Whatever happened, she would not let Bertram begin to chafe against those
      bonds!
    </p>
    <p>
      Having arrived at this heroic and (to her) eminently satisfactory state of
      mind, Billy turned from the window and fell to work on a piece of
      manuscript music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Brush up against other interests,'&rdquo; she admonished herself sternly, as
      she reached for her pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theoretically it was beautiful; but practically&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy began at once to be that oak. Not an hour after she had first seen
      the fateful notice of &ldquo;When the Honeymoon Wanes,&rdquo; Bertram's ring sounded
      at the door down-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram always let himself in with his latchkey; but, from the first of
      Billy's being there, he had given a peculiar ring at the bell which would
      bring his wife flying to welcome him if she were anywhere in the house.
      To-day, when the bell sounded, Billy sprang as usual to her feet, with a
      joyous &ldquo;There's Bertram!&rdquo; But the next moment she fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, Billy Neilson Henshaw! Learn to cultivate a comfortable
      indifference to your husband's comings and goings,&rdquo; she whispered
      fiercely. Then she sat down and fell to work again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later she heard her husband's voice talking to some one&mdash;Pete,
      she surmised. &ldquo;Here? You say she's here?&rdquo; Then she heard Bertram's quick
      step on the stairs. The next minute, very quietly, he came to her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; he ejaculated gayly, as she rose to receive his kiss. &ldquo;I thought I'd
      find you asleep, when you didn't hear my ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy reddened a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I wasn't asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn't hear&mdash;&rdquo; Bertram stopped abruptly, an odd look in his
      eyes. &ldquo;Maybe you did hear it, though,&rdquo; he corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy colored more confusedly. The fact that she looked so distressed did
      not tend to clear Bertram's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, Billy, I didn't mean to insist on your coming to meet
      me,&rdquo; he began a little stiffly; but Billy interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Bertram, I just love to go to meet you,&rdquo; she maintained indignantly.
      Then, remembering just in time, she amended: &ldquo;That is, I did love to meet
      you, until&mdash;&rdquo; With a sudden realization that she certainly had not
      helped matters any, she came to an embarrassed pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      A puzzled frown showed on Bertram's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did love to meet me until&mdash;&rdquo; he repeated after her; then his
      face changed. &ldquo;Billy, you aren't&mdash;you <i>can't</i> be laying up last
      night against me!&rdquo; he reproached her a little irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night? Why, of course not,&rdquo; retorted Billy, in a panic at the bare
      mention of the &ldquo;test&rdquo; which&mdash;according to &ldquo;When the Honeymoon Wanes&rdquo;&mdash;was
      at the root of all her misery. Already she thought she detected in
      Bertram's voice signs that he was beginning to chafe against those
      &ldquo;bonds.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is a matter of&mdash;of the utmost indifference to me what
      time you come home at night, my dear,&rdquo; she finished airily, as she sat
      down to her work again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram stared; then he frowned, turned on his heel and left the room.
      Bertram, who knew nothing of the &ldquo;Talk to Young Wives&rdquo; in the newspaper at
      Billy's feet, was surprised, puzzled, and just a bit angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, left alone, jabbed her pen with such force against her paper that
      the note she was making became an unsightly blot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if this is what that man calls being 'comfortably indifferent,' I'd
      hate to try the <i>un</i>comfortable kind,&rdquo; she muttered with emphasis.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE DINNER BILLY TRIED TO GET
    </h2>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding what Billy was disposed to regard as the non-success of
      her first attempt to profit by the &ldquo;Talk to Young Wives;&rdquo; she still
      frantically tried to avert the waning of her honeymoon. Assiduously she
      cultivated the prescribed &ldquo;indifference,&rdquo; and with at least apparent
      enthusiasm she sought the much-to-be-desired &ldquo;outside interests.&rdquo; That is,
      she did all this when she thought of it when something reminded her of the
      sword of destruction hanging over her happiness. At other times, when she
      was just being happy without question, she was her old self impulsive,
      affectionate, and altogether adorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, under these circumstances, her conduct was somewhat erratic.
      For three days, perhaps, she would fly to the door at her husband's ring,
      and hang upon his every movement. Then, for the next three, she would be a
      veritable will-o'-the-wisp for elusiveness, caring, apparently, not one
      whit whether her husband came or went until poor Bertram, at his wit's
      end, scourged himself with a merciless catechism as to what he had done to
      vex her. Then, perhaps, just when he had nerved himself almost to the
      point of asking her what was the trouble, there would come another change,
      bringing back to him the old Billy, joyous, winsome, and devoted, plainly
      caring nothing for anybody or anything but himself. Scarcely, however,
      would he become sure that it was his Billy back again before she was off
      once more, quite beyond his reach, singing with Arkwright and Alice
      Greggory, playing with Tommy Dunn, plunging into some club or church work&mdash;anything
      but being with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That all this was puzzling and disquieting to Bertram, Billy not once
      suspected. Billy, so far as she was concerned, was but cultivating a
      comfortable indifference, brushing up against outside interests, and being
      an oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      December passed, and January came, bringing Miss Marguerite Winthrop to
      her Boston home. Bertram's arm was &ldquo;as good as ever&rdquo; now, according to its
      owner; and the sittings for the new portrait began at once. This left
      Billy even more to her own devices, for Bertram entered into his new work
      with an enthusiasm born of a glad relief from forced idleness, and a
      consuming eagerness to prove that even though he had failed the first
      time, he could paint a portrait of Marguerite Winthrop that would be a
      credit to himself, a conclusive retort to his critics, and a source of
      pride to his once mortified friends. With his whole heart, therefore, he
      threw himself into the work before him, staying sometimes well into the
      afternoon on the days Miss Winthrop could find time between her social
      engagements to give him a sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on such a day, toward the middle of the month, that Billy was
      called to the telephone at half-past twelve o'clock to speak to her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, dear,&rdquo; began Bertram at once, &ldquo;if you don't mind I'm staying to
      luncheon at Miss Winthrop's kind request. We've changed the pose&mdash;neither
      of us was satisfied, you know&mdash;but we haven't quite settled on the
      new one. Miss Winthrop has two whole hours this afternoon that she can
      give me if I'll stay; and, of course, under the circumstances, I want to
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; echoed Billy. Billy's voice was indomitably cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear. I knew you'd understand,&rdquo; sighed Bertram, contentedly.
      &ldquo;You see, really, two whole hours, so&mdash;it's a chance I can't afford
      to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you can't,&rdquo; echoed Billy, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right then. Good-by till to-night,&rdquo; called the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; answered Billy, still cheerfully. As she turned away, however,
      she tossed her head. &ldquo;A new pose, indeed!&rdquo; she muttered, with some
      asperity. &ldquo;Just as if there could be a <i>new</i> pose after all those she
      tried last year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after luncheon Pete and Eliza started for South Boston to pay
      a visit to Eliza's mother, and it was soon after they left the house that
      Bertram called his wife up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, dearie, I forgot to tell you,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;but I met an old friend in
      the subway this morning, and I&mdash;well, I remembered what you said
      about bringing 'em home to dinner next time, so I asked him for to-night.
      Do you mind? It's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind? Of course not! I'm glad you did,&rdquo; plunged in Billy, with feverish
      eagerness. (Even now, just the bare mention of anything connected with
      that awful &ldquo;test&rdquo; night was enough to set Billy's nerves to tingling.) &ldquo;I
      want you to always bring them home, Bertram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, dear. We'll be there at six o'clock then. It's&mdash;it's
      Calderwell, this time. You remember Calderwell, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not&mdash;<i>Hugh</i> Calderwell?&rdquo; Billy's question was a little faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Bertram laughed oddly, and lowered his voice. &ldquo;I suspect <i>once</i>
      I wouldn't have brought him home to you. I was too jealous. But now&mdash;well,
      now maybe I want him to see what he's lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Bertram!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Bertram only laughed mischievously, and called a gay &ldquo;Good-by till
      to-night, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy, at her end of the wires, hung up the receiver and backed against
      the wall a little palpitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell! To dinner&mdash;Calderwell! Did she remember Calderwell? Did
      she, indeed! As if one could easily forget the man that, for a year or
      two, had proposed marriage as regularly (and almost as lightly!) as he had
      torn a monthly leaf from his calendar! Besides, was it not he, too, who
      had said that Bertram would never love any girl, <i>really</i>; that it
      would be only the tilt of her chin or the turn of her head that he loved&mdash;to
      paint? And now he was coming to dinner&mdash;and with Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well, he should see! He should see that Bertram <i>did</i> love her;
      <i>her</i>&mdash;not the tilt of her chin nor the turn of her head. He
      should see how happy they were, what a good wife she made, and how devoted
      and <i>satisfied</i> Bertram was in his home. He should see! And forthwith
      Billy picked up her skirts and tripped up-stairs to select her very
      prettiest house-gown to do honor to the occasion. Up-stairs, however, one
      thing and another delayed her, so that it was four o'clock when she turned
      her attention to her toilet; and it was while she was hesitating whether
      to be stately and impressive in royally sumptuous blue velvet and ermine,
      or cozy and tantalizingly homy{sic} in bronze-gold crêpe de Chine and
      swan's-down, that the telephone bell rang again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza and Pete had not yet returned; so, as before, Billy answered it.
      This time Eliza's shaking voice came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, Eliza?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm, it's me, ma'am. It's about Uncle Pete. He's give us a turn that's
      'most scared us out of our wits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete! You mean he's sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, he was. That is, he is, too&mdash;only he's better, now,
      thank goodness,&rdquo; panted Eliza. &ldquo;But he ain't hisself yet. He's that white
      and shaky! Would you&mdash;could you&mdash;that is, would you mind if we
      didn't come back till into the evenin', maybe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course not,&rdquo; cried Pete's mistress, quickly. &ldquo;Don't come a minute
      before he's able, Eliza. Don't come until to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eliza gave a trembling little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, ma'am; but there wouldn't be no keepin' of Uncle Pete here
      till then. If he could take five steps alone he'd start now. But he can't.
      He says he'll be all right pretty quick, though. He's had 'em before&mdash;these
      spells&mdash;but never quite so bad as this, I guess; an' he's worryin'
      somethin' turrible 'cause he can't start for home right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cut in Mrs. Bertram Henshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm. I knew you'd feel that way,&rdquo; stammered Eliza, gratefully. &ldquo;You
      see, I couldn't leave him to come alone, and besides, anyhow, I'd have to
      stay, for mother ain't no more use than a wet dish-rag at such times,
      she's that scared herself. And she ain't very well, too. So if&mdash;if
      you <i>could</i> get along&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we can! And tell Pete not to worry one bit. I'm so sorry he's
      sick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, ma'am. Then we'll be there some time this evenin',&rdquo; sighed
      Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the telephone Billy turned away with a troubled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete <i>is</i> ill,&rdquo; she was saying to herself. &ldquo;I don't like the looks
      of it; and he's so faithful he'd come if&mdash;&rdquo; With a little cry Billy
      stopped short. Then, tremblingly, she sank into the nearest chair.
      &ldquo;Calderwell&mdash;and he's coming to <i>dinner!</i>&rdquo; she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two benumbed minutes Billy sat staring at nothing. Then she ran to the
      telephone and called the Annex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Hannah, for heaven's sake, if you love me,&rdquo; pleaded Billy, &ldquo;send
      Rosa down instanter! Pete is sick over to South Boston, and Eliza is with
      him; and Bertram is bringing Hugh Calderwell home to dinner. <i>Can</i>
      you spare Rosa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my grief and conscience, Billy! Of course I can&mdash;I mean I could&mdash;but
      Rosa isn't here, dear child! It's her day out, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear, of course it is! I might have known, if I'd thought; but Pete and
      Eliza have spoiled me. They never take days out at meal time&mdash;both
      together, I mean&mdash;until to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear child, what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I've got to think. I <i>must</i> do something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you must! I'd come over myself if it wasn't for my cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I'd let you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't anybody here, only Tommy. Even Alice is gone. Oh, Billy,
      Billy, this only goes to prove what I've always said, that <i>no</i> woman
      <i>ought</i> to be a wife until she's an efficient housekeeper; and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Aunt Hannah, I know,&rdquo; moaned Billy, frenziedly. &ldquo;But I am a
      wife, and I'm not an efficient housekeeper; and Hugh Calderwell won't wait
      for me to learn. He's coming to-night. <i>To-night!</i> And I've got to do
      something. Never mind. I'll fix it some way. Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Billy, Billy! Oh, my grief and conscience,&rdquo; fluttered Aunt Hannah's
      voice across the wires as Billy snapped the receiver into place.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second time that day Billy backed palpitatingly against the wall.
      Her eyes sought the clock fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen minutes past four. She had an hour and three quarters. She could,
      of course, telephone Bertram to dine Calderwell at a club or some hotel.
      But to do this now, the very first time, when it had been her own
      suggestion that he &ldquo;bring them home&rdquo;&mdash;no, no, she could not do that!
      Anything but that! Besides, very likely she could not reach Bertram,
      anyway. Doubtless he had left the Winthrops' by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Marie. She could telephone Marie. But Marie could not very well
      come just now, she knew; and then, too, there was Cyril to be taken into
      consideration. How Cyril would gibe at the wife who had to call in all the
      neighbors just because her husband was bringing home a friend to dinner!
      How he would&mdash;Well, he shouldn't! He should not have the chance. So,
      there!
    </p>
    <p>
      With a jerk Mrs. Bertram Henshaw pulled herself away from the wall and
      stood erect. Her eyes snapped, and the very poise of her chin spelled
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well, she would show them. Was not Bertram bringing this man home
      because he was proud of her? Mighty proud he would be if she had to call
      in half of Boston to get his dinner for him! Nonsense! She would get it
      herself. Was not this the time, if ever, to be an oak? A vine, doubtless,
      would lean and cling and telephone, and whine &ldquo;I can't!&rdquo; But not an oak.
      An oak would hold up its head and say &ldquo;I can!&rdquo; An oak would go ahead and
      get that dinner. She would be an oak. She would get that dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if she didn't know how to cook bread and cake and pies and things?
      One did not have to cook bread and cake and pies just to get a dinner&mdash;meat
      and potatoes and vegetables! Besides, she <i>could</i> make peach
      fritters. She knew she could. She would show them!
    </p>
    <p>
      And with actually a bit of song on her lips, Billy skipped up-stairs for
      her ruffled apron and dust-cap&mdash;two necessary accompaniments to this
      dinner-getting, in her opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy found the apron and dust-cap with no difficulty; but it took fully
      ten of her precious minutes to unearth from its obscure hiding-place the
      blue-and-gold &ldquo;Bride's Helper&rdquo; cookbook, one of Aunt Hannah's wedding
      gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way to the kitchen, Billy planned her dinner. As was natural,
      perhaps, she chose the things she herself would like to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't attempt anything very elaborate,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;It would
      be wiser to have something simple, like chicken pie, perhaps. I love
      chicken pie! And I'll have oyster stew first&mdash;that is, after the
      grapefruit. Just oysters boiled in milk must be easier than soup to make.
      I'll begin with grapefruit with a cherry in it, like Pete fixes it. Those
      don't have to be cooked, anyhow. I'll have fish&mdash;Bertram loves the
      fish course. Let me see, halibut, I guess, with egg sauce. I won't have
      any roast; nothing but the chicken pie. And I'll have squash and onions. I
      can have a salad, easy&mdash;just lettuce and stuff. That doesn't have to
      be cooked. Oh, and the peach fritters, if I get time to make them. For
      dessert&mdash;well, maybe I can find a new pie or pudding in the cookbook.
      I want to use that cookbook for something, after hunting all this time for
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the kitchen Billy found exquisite neatness, and silence. The first
      brought an approving light to her eyes; but the second, for some
      unapparent reason, filled her heart with vague misgiving. This feeling,
      however, Billy resolutely cast from her as she crossed the room, dropped
      her book on to the table, and turned toward the shining black stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an excellent fire. Glowing points of light showed that only a
      good draft was needed to make the whole mass of coal red-hot. Billy,
      however, did not know this. Her experience of fires was confined to
      burning wood in open grates&mdash;and wood in open grates had to be poked
      to make it red and glowing. With confident alacrity now, therefore, Billy
      caught up the poker, thrust it into the mass of coals and gave them a fine
      stirring up. Then she set back the lid of the stove and went to hunt up
      the ingredients for her dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time Billy had searched five minutes and found no chicken, no
      oysters, and no halibut, it occurred to her that her larder was not, after
      all, an open market, and that one's provisions must be especially ordered
      to fit one's needs. As to ordering them now&mdash;Billy glanced at the
      clock and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's almost five, already, and they'd never get here in time,&rdquo; she sighed
      regretfully. &ldquo;I'll have to have something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy looked now, not for what she wanted, but for what she could find.
      And she found: some cold roast lamb, at which she turned up her nose; an
      uncooked beefsteak, which she appropriated doubtfully; a raw turnip and a
      head of lettuce, which she hailed with glee; and some beets, potatoes,
      onions, and grapefruit, from all of which she took a generous supply. Thus
      laden she went back to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spread upon the table they made a brave show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I'll have quite a dinner, after all,&rdquo; she triumphed, cocking
      her head happily. &ldquo;And now for the dessert,&rdquo; she finished, pouncing on the
      cookbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while she was turning the leaves to find the pies and puddings that
      she ran across the vegetables and found the word &ldquo;beets&rdquo; staring her in
      the face. Mechanically she read the line below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winter beets will require three hours to cook. Use hot water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy's startled eyes sought the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours&mdash;and it was five, now!
    </p>
    <p>
      Frenziedly, then, she ran her finger down the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Onions, one and one-half hours. Use hot water. Turnips require a long
      time, but if cut thin they will cook in an hour and a quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour and a quarter, indeed!&rdquo; she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't there anything anywhere that doesn't take forever to cook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early peas&mdash;... green corn&mdash;... summer squash&mdash;...&rdquo;
       mumbled Billy's dry lips. &ldquo;But what do folks eat in January&mdash;<i>January</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the apparently inoffensive sentence, &ldquo;New potatoes will boil in
      thirty minutes,&rdquo; that brought fresh terror to Billy's soul, and set her to
      fluttering the cookbook leaves with renewed haste. If it took <i>new</i>
      potatoes thirty minutes to cook, how long did it take old ones? In vain
      she searched for the answer. There were plenty of potatoes. They were
      mashed, whipped, scalloped, creamed, fried, and broiled; they were made
      into puffs, croquettes, potato border, and potato snow. For many of these
      they were boiled first&mdash;&ldquo;until tender,&rdquo; one rule said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that doesn't tell me how long it takes to get 'em tender,&rdquo; fumed
      Billy, despairingly. &ldquo;I suppose they think anybody ought to know that&mdash;but
      I don't!&rdquo; Suddenly her eyes fell once more on the instructions for boiling
      turnips, and her face cleared. &ldquo;If it helps to cut turnips thin, why not
      potatoes?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I <i>can</i> do that, anyhow; and I will,&rdquo; she
      finished, with a sigh of relief, as she caught up half a dozen potatoes
      and hurried into the pantry for a knife. A few minutes later, the
      potatoes, peeled, and cut almost to wafer thinness, were dumped into a
      basin of cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! now I guess you'll cook,&rdquo; nodded Billy to the dish in her hand as
      she hurried to the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chilled by an ominous unresponsiveness, Billy lifted the stove lid and
      peered inside. Only a mass of black and graying coals greeted her. The
      fire was out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think that even you had to go back on me like this!&rdquo; upbraided Billy,
      eyeing the dismal mass with reproachful gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      This disaster, however, as Billy knew, was not so great as it seemed, for
      there was still the gas stove. In the old days, under Dong Ling's rule,
      there had been no gas stove. Dong Ling disapproved of &ldquo;devil stoves&rdquo; that
      had &ldquo;no coalee, no woodee, but burned like hellee.&rdquo; Eliza, however, did
      approve of them; and not long after her arrival, a fine one had been put
      in for her use. So now Billy soon had her potatoes with a brisk blaze
      under them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In frantic earnest, then, Billy went to work. Brushing the discarded
      onions, turnip, and beets into a pail under the table, she was still
      confronted with the beefsteak, lettuce, and grapefruit. All but the
      beefsteak she pushed to one side with gentle pats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're all right,&rdquo; she nodded to them. &ldquo;I can use you. You don't have to
      be cooked, bless your hearts! But <i>you</i>&mdash;!&rdquo; Billy scowled at the
      beefsteak and ran her finger down the index of the &ldquo;Bride's Helper&rdquo;&mdash;Billy
      knew how to handle that book now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don't&mdash;not for me!&rdquo; she muttered, after a minute, shaking
      her finger at the tenderloin on the table. &ldquo;I haven't got any 'hot coals,'
      and I thought a 'gridiron' was where they played football; though it seems
      it's some sort of a dish to cook you in, here&mdash;but I shouldn't know
      it from a teaspoon, probably, if I should see it. No, sir! It's back to
      the refrigerator for you, and a nice cold sensible roast leg of lamb for
      me, that doesn't have to be cooked. Understand? <i>Cooked</i>,&rdquo; she
      finished, as she carried the beefsteak away and took possession of the
      hitherto despised cold lamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Billy made a mad search through cupboards and shelves. This time
      she bore back in triumph a can of corn, another of tomatoes, and a glass
      jar of preserved peaches. In the kitchen a cheery bubbling from the
      potatoes on the stove greeted her. Billy's spirits rose with the steam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Spunkie,&rdquo; she said gayly to the cat, who had just uncurled from a
      nap behind the stove. &ldquo;Tell me I can't get up a dinner! And maybe we'll
      have the peach fritters, too,&rdquo; she chirped. &ldquo;I've got the peach-part,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Billy did not have the peach fritters, after all. She got out the
      sugar and the flour, to be sure, and she made a great ado looking up the
      rule; but a hurried glance at the clock sent her into the dining-room to
      set the table, and all thought of the peach fritters was given up.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE DINNER BILLY GOT
    </h2>
    <p>
      At five minutes of six Bertram and Calderwell came. Bertram gave his
      peculiar ring and let himself in with his latchkey; but Billy did not meet
      him in the hall, nor in the drawing-room. Excusing himself, Bertram
      hurried up-stairs. Billy was not in her room, nor anywhere on that floor.
      She was not in William's room. Coming down-stairs to the hall again,
      Bertram confronted William, who had just come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Billy?&rdquo; demanded the young husband, with just a touch of
      irritation, as if he suspected William of having Billy in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      William stared slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don't know. Isn't she here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll ask Pete,&rdquo; frowned Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dining-room Bertram found no one, though the table was prettily
      set, and showed half a grapefruit at each place. In the kitchen&mdash;in
      the kitchen Bertram found a din of rattling tin, an odor of burned food&mdash;,
      a confusion of scattered pots and pans, a frightened cat who peered at him
      from under a littered stove, and a flushed, disheveled young woman in a
      blue dust-cap and ruffled apron, whom he finally recognized as his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Billy!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, who was struggling with something at the sink, turned sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram Henshaw,&rdquo; she panted, &ldquo;I used to think you were wonderful because
      you could paint a picture. I even used to think I was a little wonderful
      because I could write a song. Well, I don't any more! But I'll tell you
      who <i>is</i> wonderful. It's Eliza and Rosa, and all the rest of those
      women who can get a meal on to the table all at once, so it's fit to eat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Billy!&rdquo; gasped Bertram again, falling back to the door he had closed
      behind him. &ldquo;What in the world does this mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean? It means I'm getting dinner,&rdquo; choked Billy. &ldquo;Can't you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;Pete! Eliza!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're sick&mdash;I mean he's sick; and I said I'd do it. I'd be an oak.
      But how did I know there wasn't anything in the house except stuff that
      took hours to cook&mdash;only potatoes? And how did I know that <i>they</i>
      cooked in no time, and then got all smushy and wet staying in the water?
      And how did I know that everything else would stick on and burn on till
      you'd used every dish there was in the house to cook 'em in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Billy!&rdquo; gasped Bertram, for the third time. And then, because he had
      been married only six months instead of six years, he made the mistake of
      trying to argue with a woman whose nerves were already at the snapping
      point. &ldquo;But, dear, it was so foolish of you to do all this! Why didn't you
      telephone? Why didn't you get somebody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like an irate little tigress, Billy turned at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram Henshaw,&rdquo; she flamed angrily, &ldquo;if you don't go up-stairs and tend
      to that man up there, I shall <i>scream</i>. Now go! I'll be up when I
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Bertram went.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not so very long, after all, before Billy came in to greet her
      guest. She was not stately and imposing in royally sumptuous blue velvet
      and ermine; nor yet was she cozy and homy in bronze-gold crêpe de Chine
      and swan's-down. She was just herself in a pretty little morning house
      gown of blue gingham. She was minus the dust-cap and the ruffled apron,
      but she had a dab of flour on the left cheek, and a smutch of crock on her
      forehead. She had, too, a cut finger on her right hand, and a burned thumb
      on her left. But she was Billy&mdash;and being Billy, she advanced with a
      bright smile and held out a cordial hand&mdash;not even wincing when the
      cut finger came under Calderwell's hearty clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to see you,&rdquo; she welcomed him. &ldquo;You'll excuse my not appearing
      sooner, I'm sure, for&mdash;didn't Bertram tell you?&mdash;I'm playing
      Bridget to-night. But dinner is ready now, and we'll go down, please,&rdquo; she
      smiled, as she laid a light hand on her guest's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind her, Bertram, remembering the scene in the kitchen, stared in sheer
      amazement. Bertram, it might be mentioned again, had been married six
      months, not six years.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Billy had intended to serve for a &ldquo;simple dinner&rdquo; that night was:
      grapefruit with cherries, oyster stew, boiled halibut with egg sauce,
      chicken pie, squash, onions, and potatoes, peach fritters, a &ldquo;lettuce and
      stuff&rdquo; salad, and some new pie or pudding. What she did serve was:
      grapefruit (without the cherries), cold roast lamb, potatoes (a mush of
      sogginess), tomatoes (canned, and slightly burned), corn (canned, and very
      much burned), lettuce (plain); and for dessert, preserved peaches and cake
      (the latter rather dry and stale). Such was Billy's dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grapefruit everybody ate. The cold lamb too, met with a hearty
      reception, especially after the potatoes, corn, and tomatoes were served&mdash;and
      tasted. Outwardly, through it all, Billy was gayety itself. Inwardly she
      was burning up with anger and mortification. And because she was all this,
      there was, apparently, no limit to her laughter and sparkling repartee as
      she talked with Calderwell, her guest&mdash;the guest who, according to
      her original plans, was to be shown how happy she and Bertram were, what a
      good wife she made, and how devoted and <i>satisfied</i> Bertram was in
      his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      William, picking at his dinner&mdash;as only a hungry man can pick at a
      dinner that is uneatable&mdash;watched Billy with a puzzled, uneasy frown.
      Bertram, choking over the few mouthfuls he ate, marked his wife's animated
      face and Calderwell's absorbed attention, and settled into gloomy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it could not continue forever. The preserved peaches were eaten at
      last, and the stale cake left. (Billy had forgotten the coffee&mdash;which
      was just as well, perhaps.) Then the four trailed up-stairs to the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o'clock an anxious Eliza and a remorseful, apologetic Pete came
      home and descended to the horror the once orderly kitchen and dining-room
      had become. At ten, Calderwell, with very evident reluctance, tore himself
      away from Billy's gay badinage, and said good night. At two minutes past
      ten, an exhausted, nerve-racked Billy was trying to cry on the shoulders
      of both Uncle William and Bertram at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, child, don't! It went off all right,&rdquo; patted Uncle William.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, darling,&rdquo; pleaded Bertram, &ldquo;please don't cry so! As if I'd ever
      let you step foot in that kitchen again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Billy raised a tear-wet face, aflame with indignant determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I'd ever let you keep me <i>from</i> it, Bertram Henshaw, after
      this!&rdquo; she contested. &ldquo;I'm not going to do another thing in all my life
      but <i>cook!</i> When I think of the stuff we had to eat, after all the
      time I took to get it, I'm simply crazy! Do you think I'd run the risk of
      such a thing as this ever happening again?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI. CALDERWELL DOES SOME QUESTIONING
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the day after his dinner with Mr. and Mrs. Bertram Henshaw, Hugh
      Calderwell left Boston and did not return until more than a month had
      passed. One of his first acts, when he did come, was to look up Mr. M. J.
      Arkwright at the address which Billy had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell had not seen Arkwright since they parted in Paris some two
      years before, after a six-months tramp through Europe together. Calderwell
      liked Arkwright then, greatly, and he lost no time now in renewing the
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The address, as given by Billy, proved to be an attractive but modest
      apartment hotel near the Conservatory of Music; and Calderwell was
      delighted to find Arkwright at home in his comfortable little bachelor
      suite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright greeted him most cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if it isn't Calderwell! And how's Mont Blanc? Or
      is it the Killarney Lakes this time, or maybe the Sphinx that I should
      inquire for, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess again,&rdquo; laughed Calderwell, throwing off his heavy coat and
      settling himself comfortably in the inviting-looking morris chair his
      friend pulled forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sha'n't do it,&rdquo; retorted Arkwright, with a smile. &ldquo;I never gamble on
      palpable uncertainties, except for a chance throw or two, as I gave a
      minute ago. Your movements are altogether too erratic, and too
      far-reaching, for ordinary mortals to keep track of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, maybe you're right,&rdquo; grinned Calderwell, appreciatively. &ldquo;Anyhow,
      you would have lost this time, sure thing, for I've been working.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen the doctor yet?&rdquo; queried Arkwright, coolly, pushing the cigars
      across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks&mdash;for both,&rdquo; sniffed Calderwell, with a reproachful glance,
      helping himself. &ldquo;Your good judgment in some matters is still unimpaired,
      I see,&rdquo; he observed, tapping the little gilded band which had told him the
      cigar was an old favorite. &ldquo;As to other matters, however,&mdash;you're
      wrong again, my friend, in your surmise. I am not sick, and I have been
      working.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? Well, I'm told they have very good specialists here. Some one of them
      ought to hit your case. Still&mdash;how long has it been running?&rdquo;
       Arkwright's face showed only grave concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, let up, Arkwright,&rdquo; snapped Calderwell, striking his match
      alight with a vigorous jerk. &ldquo;I'll admit I haven't ever given any <i>special</i>
      indication of an absorbing passion for work. But what can you expect of a
      fellow born with a whole dozen silver spoons in his mouth? And that's what
      I was, according to Bertram Henshaw. According to him again, it's a wonder
      I ever tried to feed myself; and perhaps he's right&mdash;with my mouth
      already so full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; laughed Arkwright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be that as it may. I'm going to feed myself, and I'm going to earn
      my feed, too. I haven't climbed a mountain or paddled a canoe, for a year.
      I've been in Chicago cultivating the acquaintance of John Doe and Richard
      Roe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. I studied it here for a while, before that bout of ours a couple of
      years ago. Billy drove me away, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy!&mdash;er&mdash;Mrs. Henshaw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I thought I told you. She turned down my tenth-dozen proposal so
      emphatically that I lost all interest in Boston and took to the tall
      timber again. But I've come back. A friend of my father's wrote me to come
      on and consider a good opening there was in his law office. I came on a
      month ago, and considered. Then I went back to pack up. Now I've come for
      good, and here I am. You have my history to date. Now tell me of yourself.
      You're looking as fit as a penny from the mint, even though you have
      discarded that 'lovely' brown beard. Was that a concession to&mdash;er&mdash;<i>Mary
      Jane</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright lifted a quick hand of protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Michael Jeremiah,' please. There is no 'Mary Jane,' now,&rdquo; he said a bit
      stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other stared a little. Then he gave a low chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Michael Jeremiah,'&rdquo; he repeated musingly, eyeing the glowing tip of his
      cigar. &ldquo;And to think how that mysterious 'M. J.' used to tantalize me! Do
      you mean,&rdquo; he added, turning slowly, &ldquo;that no one calls you 'Mary Jane'
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if they know what is best for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Calderwell noted the smouldering fire in the other's eyes a little
      curiously. &ldquo;Very well. I'll take the hint&mdash;Michael Jeremiah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Arkwright relaxed a little. &ldquo;To tell the truth, I've had quite
      enough now&mdash;of Mary Jane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. So be it,&rdquo; nodded the other, still regarding his friend
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;But tell me&mdash;what of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing to tell. You've seen. I'm here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Very pretty,&rdquo; scoffed Calderwell. &ldquo;Then if <i>you</i> won't tell,
      I <i>will</i>. I saw Billy a month ago, you see. It seems you've hit the
      trail for Grand Opera, as you threatened to that night in Paris; but you
      <i>haven't</i> brought up in vaudeville, as you prophesied you would do&mdash;though,
      for that matter, judging from the plums some of the stars are picking on
      the vaudeville stage, nowadays, that isn't to be sneezed at. But Billy
      says you've made two or three appearances already on the sacred boards
      themselves&mdash;one of them a subscription performance&mdash;and that you
      created no end of a sensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! I'm merely a student at the Opera School here,&rdquo; scowled
      Arkwright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Billy said you were that, but she also said you wouldn't be,
      long. That you'd already had one good offer&mdash;I'm not speaking of
      marriage&mdash;and that you were going abroad next summer, and that they
      were all insufferably proud of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; scowled Arkwright, again, coloring like a girl. &ldquo;That is only
      some of&mdash;of Mrs. Henshaw's kind flattery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell jerked the cigar from between his lips, and sat suddenly
      forward in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arkwright, tell me about them. How are they making it go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Make what go?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Henshaws. Is she happy? Is he&mdash;on the square?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright's face darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; he began; but Calderwell interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come; don't be squeamish. You think I'm butting into what doesn't
      concern me; but I'm not. What concerns Billy does concern me. And if he
      doesn't make her happy, I'll&mdash;I'll kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself Arkwright laughed. The vehemence of the other's words,
      and the fierceness with which he puffed at his cigar as he fell back in
      his chair were most expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't think you need to load revolvers nor sharpen daggers, just
      yet,&rdquo; he observed grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell laughed this time, though without much mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not in love with Billy, now,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Please don't think I
      am. I shouldn't see her if I was, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright changed his position suddenly, bringing his face into the
      shadow. Calderwell talked on without pausing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not in love with Billy. But Billy's a trump. You know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; The words were low, but steadily spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you do! We all do. And we want her happy. But as for her
      marrying Bertram&mdash;you could have bowled me over with a soap bubble
      when I heard she'd done it. Now understand: Bertram is a good fellow, and
      I like him. I've known him all his life, and he's all right. Oh, six or
      eight years ago, to be sure, he got in with a set of fellows&mdash;Bob
      Seaver and his clique&mdash;that were no good. Went in for Bohemianism,
      and all that rot. It wasn't good for Bertram. He's got the confounded
      temperament that goes with his talent, I suppose&mdash;though why a man
      can't paint a picture, or sing a song, and keep his temper and a level
      head I don't see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can,&rdquo; cut in Arkwright, with curt emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Well, that's what I think. But, about this marriage business.
      Bertram admires a pretty face wherever he sees it&mdash;<i>to paint</i>,
      and always has. Not but that he's straight as a string with women&mdash;I
      don't mean that; but girls are always just so many pictures to be picked
      up on his brushes and transferred to his canvases. And as for his settling
      down and marrying anybody for keeps, right along&mdash;Great Scott!
      imagine Bertram Henshaw as a <i>domestic</i> man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright stirred restlessly as he spoke up in quick defense:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but he is, I assure you. I&mdash;I've seen them in their home
      together&mdash;many times. I think they are&mdash;very happy.&rdquo; Arkwright
      spoke with decision, though still a little diffidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell was silent. He had picked up the little gilt band he had torn
      from his cigar and was fingering it musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I've seen them&mdash;once,&rdquo; he said, after a minute. &ldquo;I took dinner
      with them when I was on, a month ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At something in Arkwright's voice, Calderwell turned quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Why do you say it like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright laughed. The constraint fled from his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I may as well tell you. You'll hear of it. It's no secret. Mrs.
      Henshaw herself tells of it everywhere. It was her friend, Alice Greggory,
      who told me of it first, however. It seems the cook was gone, and the
      mistress had to get the dinner herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you should hear Mrs. Henshaw tell the story now, or Bertram. It seems
      she knew nothing whatever about cooking, and her trials and tribulations
      in getting that dinner on to the table were only one degree worse than the
      dinner itself, according to her story. Didn't you&mdash;er&mdash;notice
      anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notice anything!&rdquo; exploded Calderwell. &ldquo;I noticed that Billy was so
      brilliant she fairly radiated sparks; and I noticed that Bertram was so
      glum he&mdash;he almost radiated thunderclaps. Then I saw that Billy's
      high spirits were all assumed to cover a threatened burst of tears, and I
      laid it all to him. I thought he'd said something to hurt her; and I could
      have punched him. Great Scott! Was <i>that</i> what ailed them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it was. Alice says that since then Mrs. Henshaw has fairly
      haunted the kitchen, begging Eliza to teach her everything, <i>every
      single thing</i> she knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that isn't just like Billy! She never does anything by halves. By
      George, but she was game over that dinner! I can see it all now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice says she's really learning to cook, in spite of old Pete's horror,
      and Eliza's pleadings not to spoil her pretty hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Pete is back all right? What a faithful old soul he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright frowned slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he's faithful, but he isn't all right, by any means. I think he's a
      sick man, myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes Billy let him work, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him!&rdquo; sniffed Arkwright. &ldquo;I'd like to see you try to stop him! Mrs.
      Henshaw begs and pleads with him to stop, but he scouts the idea. Pete is
      thoroughly and unalterably convinced that the family would starve to death
      if it weren't for him; and Mrs. Henshaw says that she'll admit he has some
      grounds for his opinion when one remembers the condition of the kitchen
      and dining-room the night she presided over them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Billy!&rdquo; chuckled Calderwell. &ldquo;I'd have gone down into the kitchen
      myself if I'd suspected what was going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it's well you didn't&mdash;if Bertram's picture of what he found
      there when he went down is a true one. Mrs. Henshaw acknowledges that even
      the cat sought refuge under the stove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if the veriest worm that crawls ever needed to seek refuge from
      Billy!&rdquo; scoffed Calderwell. &ldquo;By the way, what's this Annex I hear of?
      Bertram mentioned it, but I couldn't get either of them to tell what it
      was. Billy wouldn't, and Bertram said he couldn't&mdash;not with Billy
      shaking her head at him like that. So I had my suspicions. One of Billy's
      pet charities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't call it that.&rdquo; Arkwright's face and voice softened. &ldquo;It is
      Hillside. She still keeps it open. She calls it the Annex to her home.
      She's filled it with a crippled woman, a poor little music teacher, a lame
      boy, and Aunt Hannah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how&mdash;extraordinary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't think so. She says it's just an overflow house for the extra
      happiness she can't use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence. Calderwell laid down his cigar, pulled out
      his handkerchief, and blew his nose furiously. Then he got to his feet and
      walked to the fireplace. After a minute he turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if she isn't the beat 'em!&rdquo; he spluttered. &ldquo;And I had the gall to
      ask you if Henshaw made her&mdash;happy! Overflow house, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best of it is, the way she does it,&rdquo; smiled Arkwright. &ldquo;They're all
      the sort of people ordinary charity could never reach; and the only way
      she got them there at all was to make each one think that he or she was
      absolutely necessary to the rest of them. Even as it is, they all pay a
      little something toward the running expenses of the house. They insisted
      on that, and Mrs. Henshaw had to let them. I believe her chief difficulty
      now is that she has not less than six people whom she wishes to put into
      the two extra rooms still unoccupied, and she can't make up her mind which
      to take. Her husband says he expects to hear any day of an Annexette to
      the Annex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Calderwell, as he turned and began to walk up and down
      the room. &ldquo;Bertram is still painting, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he doing now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several things. He's up to his eyes in work. As you probably have heard,
      he met with a severe accident last summer, and lost the use of his right
      arm for many months. I believe they thought at one time he had lost it
      forever. But it's all right now, and he has several commissions for
      portraits. Alice says he's doing ideal heads again, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same old 'Face of a Girl'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so, though Alice didn't say. Of course his special work just
      now is painting the portrait of Miss Marguerite Winthrop. You may have
      heard that he tried it last year and&mdash;and didn't make quite a success
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. My sister Belle told me. She hears from Billy once in a while. Will
      it be a go, this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll hope so&mdash;for everybody's sake. I imagine no one has seen it
      yet&mdash;it's not finished; but Alice says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell turned abruptly, a quizzical smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, my son,&rdquo; he interposed, &ldquo;it strikes me that this Alice is
      saying a good deal&mdash;to you! Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright gave a light laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I told you. She is Miss Alice Greggory, Mrs. Henshaw's friend&mdash;and
      mine. I have known her for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm-m; what is she like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like? Why, she's like&mdash;like herself, of course. You'll have to know
      Alice. She's the salt of the earth&mdash;Alice is,&rdquo; smiled Arkwright,
      rising to his feet with a remonstrative gesture, as he saw Calderwell pick
      up his coat. &ldquo;What's your hurry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm-m,&rdquo; commented Calderwell again, ignoring the question. &ldquo;And when, may
      I ask, do you intend to appropriate this&mdash;er&mdash;salt&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;ah,
      season your own life with, as I might say&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright laughed. There was not the slightest trace of embarrassment in
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. <i>You're</i> on the wrong track, this time. Alice and I are good
      friends&mdash;always have been, and always will be, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more. I see her frequently. She is musical, and the Henshaws are
      good enough to ask us there often together. You will meet her, doubtless,
      now, yourself. She is frequently at the Henshaw home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm-m.&rdquo; Calderwell still eyed his host shrewdly. &ldquo;Then you'll give me a
      clear field, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; Arkwright's eyes met his friend's gaze without swerving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. However, I suppose you'll tell me, as I did you, once, that a
      right of way in such a case doesn't mean a thoroughfare for the party
      interested. If my memory serves me, I gave you right of way in Paris to
      win the affections of a certain elusive Miss Billy here in Boston, if you
      could. But I see you didn't seem to improve your opportunities,&rdquo; he
      finished teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright stooped, of a sudden, to pick up a bit of paper from the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I didn't seem to improve my opportunities.&rdquo; This
      time he did not meet Calderwell's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good-byes had been said when Calderwell turned abruptly at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, I suppose you're going to that devil's carnival at Jordan Hall
      to-morrow night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil's carnival! You don't mean&mdash;Cyril Henshaw's piano recital!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I do,&rdquo; grinned Calderwell, unabashed. &ldquo;And I'll warrant it'll be a
      devil's carnival, too. Isn't Mr. Cyril Henshaw going to play his own
      music? Oh, I know I'm hopeless, from your standpoint, but I can't help it.
      I like mine with some go in it, and a tune that you can find without
      hunting for it. And I don't like lost spirits gone mad that wail and
      shriek through ten perfectly good minutes, and then die with a gasping
      moan whose home is the tombs. However, you're going, I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; laughed the other. &ldquo;You couldn't hire Alice to miss one
      shriek of those spirits. Besides, I rather like them myself, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose you do. You're brought up on it&mdash;in your business.
      But me for the 'Merry Widow' and even the hoary 'Jingle Bells' every time!
      However, I'm going to be there&mdash;out of respect to the poor fellow's
      family. And, by the way, that's another thing that bowled me over&mdash;Cyril's
      marriage. Why, Cyril hates women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all women&mdash;we'll hope,&rdquo; smiled Arkwright. &ldquo;Do you know his
      wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much. I used to see her a little at Billy's. Music teacher, wasn't
      she? Then she's the same sort, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she isn't,&rdquo; laughed Arkwright. &ldquo;Oh, she taught music, but that was
      only because of necessity, I take it. She's domestic through and through,
      with an overwhelming passion for making puddings and darning socks, I
      hear. Alice says she believes Mrs. Cyril knows every dish and spoon by its
      Christian name, and that there's never so much as a spool of thread out of
      order in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how does Cyril stand it&mdash;the trials and tribulations of domestic
      life? Bertram used to declare that the whole Strata was aquiver with fear
      when Cyril was composing, and I remember him as a perfect bear if anybody
      so much as whispered when he was in one of his moods. I never forgot the
      night Bertram and I were up in William's room trying to sing 'When Johnnie
      comes marching home,' to the accompaniment of a banjo in Bertram's hands,
      and a guitar in mine. Gorry! it was Hugh that went marching home that
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, from reports I reckon Mrs. Cyril doesn't play either a banjo or
      a guitar,&rdquo; smiled Arkwright. &ldquo;Alice says she wears rubber heels on her
      shoes, and has put hushers on all the chair-legs, and felt-mats between
      all the plates and saucers. Anyhow, Cyril is building a new house, and he
      looks as if he were in a pretty healthy condition, as you'll see to-morrow
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I wish he'd make his music healthy, then,&rdquo; grumbled Calderwell, as
      he opened the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. FOR BILLY&mdash;SOME ADVICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      February brought busy days. The public opening of the Bohemian Ten Club
      Exhibition was to take place the sixth of March, with a private view for
      invited guests the night before; and it was at this exhibition that
      Bertram planned to show his portrait of Marguerite Winthrop. He also, if
      possible, wished to enter two or three other canvases, upon which he was
      spending all the time he could get.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram felt that he was doing very good work now. The portrait of
      Marguerite Winthrop was coming on finely. The spoiled idol of society had
      at last found a pose and a costume that suited her, and she was graciously
      pleased to give the artist almost as many sittings as he wanted. The
      &ldquo;elusive something&rdquo; in her face, which had previously been so baffling,
      was now already caught and held bewitchingly on his canvas. He was
      confident that the portrait would be a success. He was also much
      interested in another piece of work which he intended to show called &ldquo;The
      Rose.&rdquo; The model for this was a beautiful young girl he had found selling
      flowers with her father in a street booth at the North End.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, Bertram was very happy these days. He could not, to be sure,
      spend quite so much time with Billy as he wished; but she understood, of
      course, as did he, that his work must come first. He knew that she tried
      to show him that she understood it. At the same time, he could not help
      thinking, occasionally, that Billy did sometimes mind his necessary
      absorption in his painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      To himself Bertram owned that Billy was, in some ways, a puzzle to him.
      Her conduct was still erratic at times. One day he would seem to be
      everything to her; the next&mdash;almost nothing, judging by the ease with
      which she relinquished his society and substituted that of some one else:
      Arkwright, or Calderwell, for instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was another thing. Bertram was ashamed to hint even to himself
      that he was jealous of either of those men. Surely, after what had
      happened, after Billy's emphatic assertion that she had never loved any
      one but himself, it would seem not only absurd, but disloyal, that he
      should doubt for an instant Billy's entire devotion to him, and yet&mdash;there
      were times when he wished he <i>could</i> come home and not always find
      Alice Greggory, Calderwell, Arkwright, or all three of them strumming the
      piano in the drawing-room! At such times, always, though, if he did feel
      impatient, he immediately demanded of himself: &ldquo;Are you, then, the kind of
      husband that begrudges your wife young companions of her own age and
      tastes to help her while away the hours that you cannot possibly spend
      with her yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question, and the answer that his better self always gave to it, were
      usually sufficient to send him into some florists for a bunch of violets
      for Billy, or into a candy shop on a like atoning errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Billy&mdash;Billy, too, was busy these days chief of her concerns
      being, perhaps, attention to that honeymoon of hers, to see that it did
      not wane. At least, the most of her thoughts, and many of her actions,
      centered about that object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy had the book, now&mdash;the &ldquo;Talk to Young Wives.&rdquo; For a time she
      had worked with only the newspaper criticism to guide her; but, coming at
      last to the conclusion that if a little was good, more must be better, she
      had shyly gone into a bookstore one day and, with a pink blush, had asked
      for the book. Since bringing it home she had studied assiduously (though
      never if Bertram was near), keeping it well-hidden, when not in use, in a
      remote corner of her desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal in the book that Billy did not like, and there were
      some statements that worried her; but yet there was much that she tried
      earnestly to follow. She was still striving to be the oak, and she was
      still eagerly endeavoring to brush up against those necessary outside
      interests. She was so thankful, in this connection, for Alice Greggory,
      and for Arkwright and Hugh Calderwell. It was such a help that she had
      them! They were not only very pleasant and entertaining outside interests,
      but one or another of them was almost always conveniently within reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, it pleased her to think that she was furthering the pretty love
      story between Alice and Mr. Arkwright. And she <i>was</i> furthering it.
      She was sure of that. Already she could see how dependent the man was on
      Alice, how he looked to her for approbation, and appealed to her on all
      occasions, exactly as if there was not a move that he wanted to make
      without her presence near him. Billy was very sure, now, of Arkwright. She
      only wished she were as much so of Alice. But Alice troubled her. Not but
      that Alice was kindness itself to the man, either. It was only a peculiar
      something almost like fear, or constraint, that Billy thought she saw in
      Alice's eyes, sometimes, when Arkwright made a particularly intimate
      appeal. There was Calderwell, too. He, also, worried Billy. She feared he
      was going to complicate matters still more by falling in love with Alice,
      himself; and this, certainly, Billy did not want at all. As this phase of
      the matter presented itself, indeed, Billy determined to appropriate
      Calderwell a little more exclusively to herself, when the four were
      together, thus leaving Alice for Arkwright. After all, it was rather
      entertaining&mdash;this playing at Cupid's assistant. If she <i>could</i>
      not have Bertram all the time, it was fortunate that these outside
      interests were so pleasurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the mornings Billy spent in the kitchen, despite the remonstrances
      of both Pete and Eliza. Almost every meal, now, was graced with a
      palatable cake, pudding, or muffin that Billy would proudly claim as her
      handiwork. Pete still served at table, and made strenuous efforts to keep
      up all his old duties; but he was obviously growing weaker, and really
      serious blunders were beginning to be noticeable. Bertram even hinted once
      or twice that perhaps it would be just as well to insist on his going; but
      to this Billy would not give her consent. Even when one night his poor old
      trembling hands spilled half the contents of a soup plate over a new and
      costly evening gown of Billy's own, she still refused to have him
      dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Bertram, I wouldn't do it,&rdquo; she declared hotly; &ldquo;and you wouldn't,
      either. He's been here more than fifty years. It would break his heart.
      He's really too ill to work, and I wish he would go of his own accord, of
      course; but I sha'n't ever tell him to go&mdash;not if he spills soup on
      every dress I've got. I'll buy more&mdash;and more, if it's necessary.
      Bless his dear old heart! He thinks he's really serving us&mdash;and he
      is, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you're right, he <i>is!</i>&rdquo; sighed Bertram, with meaning
      emphasis, as he abandoned the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to her &ldquo;Talk to Young Wives,&rdquo; Billy found herself encountering
      advice and comment on the marriage question from still other quarters&mdash;from
      her acquaintances (mostly the feminine ones) right and left. Continually
      she was hearing such words as these:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, what can you expect, Billy? You're an old married woman, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, you'll find he's like all the rest of the husbands. You just
      wait and see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better begin with a high hand, Billy. Don't let him fool you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! If I had a husband whose business it was to look at women's
      beautiful eyes, peachy cheeks, and luxurious tresses, I should go crazy!
      It's hard enough to keep a man's eyes on yourself when his daily interests
      are supposed to be just lumps of coal and chunks of ice, without flinging
      him into the very jaws of temptation like asking him to paint a pretty
      girl's picture!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In response to all this, of course, Billy could but laugh, and blush, and
      toss back some gay reply, with a careless unconcern. But in her heart she
      did not like it. Sometimes she told herself that if there were not any
      advice or comment from anybody&mdash;either book or woman&mdash;if there
      were not anybody but just Bertram and herself, life would be just one long
      honeymoon forever and forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice Billy was tempted to go to Marie with this honeymoon
      question; but Marie was very busy these days, and very preoccupied. The
      new house that Cyril was building on Corey Hill, not far from the Annex,
      was almost finished, and Marie was immersed in the subject of
      house-furnishings and interior decoration. She was, too, still more deeply
      engrossed in the fashioning of tiny garments of the softest linen, lace,
      and woolen; and there was on her face such a look of beatific wonder and
      joy that Billy did not like to so much as hint that there was in the world
      such a book as &ldquo;When the Honeymoon Wanes: A Talk to Young Wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy tried valiantly these days not to mind that Bertram's work was so
      absorbing. She tried not to mind that his business dealt, not with lumps
      of coal and chunks of ice, but with beautiful women like Marguerite
      Winthrop who asked him to luncheon, and lovely girls like his model for
      &ldquo;The Rose&rdquo; who came freely to his studio and spent hours in the beloved
      presence, being studied for what Bertram declared was absolutely the most
      wonderful poise of head and shoulders that he had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy tried, also, these days, to so conduct herself that not by any
      chance could Calderwell suspect that sometimes she was jealous of
      Bertram's art. Not for worlds would she have had Calderwell begin to get
      the notion into his head that his old-time prophecy concerning Bertram's
      caring only for the turn of a girl's head or the tilt of her chin&mdash;to
      paint, was being fulfilled. Hence, particularly gay and cheerful was Billy
      when Calderwell was near. Nor could it be said that Billy was really
      unhappy at any time. It was only that, on occasion, the very depth of her
      happiness in Bertram's love frightened her, lest it bring disaster to
      herself or Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy still went frequently to the Annex. There were yet two unfilled
      rooms in the house. Billy was hesitating which two of six new friends of
      hers to choose as occupants; and it was one day early in March, after she
      had been talking the matter over with Aunt Hannah, that Aunt Hannah said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, Billy, if you had your way I believe you'd open another whole
      house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know?&mdash;that's just what I'm thinking of,&rdquo; retorted Billy,
      gravely. Then she laughed at Aunt Hannah's shocked gesture of protest.
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I don't expect to,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I haven't lived very long, but
      I've lived long enough to know that you can't always do what you want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as if there were anything <i>you</i> wanted to do that you don't do,
      my dear,&rdquo; reproved Aunt Hannah, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo; Billy drew in her breath with a little catch. &ldquo;I have so
      much that is lovely; and that's why I need this house, you know, for the
      overflow,&rdquo; she nodded brightly. Then, with a characteristic change of
      subject, she added: &ldquo;My, but you should have tasted of the popovers I made
      for breakfast this morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to,&rdquo; smiled Aunt Hannah. &ldquo;William says you're getting to be
      quite a cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, maybe,&rdquo; conceded Billy, doubtfully. &ldquo;Oh, I can do some things all
      right; but just wait till Pete and Eliza go away again, and Bertram brings
      home a friend to dinner. That'll tell the tale. I think now I could have
      something besides potato-mush and burned corn&mdash;but maybe I wouldn't,
      when the time came. If only I could buy everything I needed to cook with,
      I'd be all right. But I can't, I find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't buy what you need! What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, every other question I ask Eliza, she says: 'Why, I don't know; you
      have to use your judgment.' Just as if I had any judgment about how much
      salt to use, or what dish to take! Dear me, Aunt Hannah, the man that will
      grow judgment and can it as you would a mess of peas, has got his fortune
      made!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an absurd child you are, Billy,&rdquo; laughed Aunt Hannah. &ldquo;I used to
      tell Marie&mdash;By the way, how is Marie? Have you seen her lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I saw her yesterday,&rdquo; twinkled Billy. &ldquo;She had a book of
      wall-paper samples spread over the back of a chair, two bunches of samples
      of different colored damasks on the table before her, a 'Young Mother's
      Guide' propped open in another chair, and a pair of baby's socks in her
      lap with a roll each of pink, and white, and blue ribbon. She spent most
      of the time, after I had helped her choose the ribbon, in asking me if I
      thought she ought to let the baby cry and bother Cyril, or stop its crying
      and hurt the baby, because her 'Mother's Guide' says a certain amount of
      crying is needed to develop a baby's lungs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah laughed, but she frowned, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea! I guess Cyril can stand proper crying&mdash;and laughing, too&mdash;from
      his own child!&rdquo; she said then, crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but Marie is afraid he can't,&rdquo; smiled Billy. &ldquo;And that's the trouble.
      She says that's the only thing that worries her&mdash;Cyril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; ejaculated Aunt Hannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it isn't nonsense to Marie,&rdquo; retorted Billy. &ldquo;You should see the
      preparations she's made and the precautions she's taken. Actually, when I
      saw those baby's socks in her lap, I didn't know but she was going to put
      rubber heels on them! They've built the new house with deadening felt in
      all the walls, and Marie's planned the nursery and Cyril's den at opposite
      ends of the house; and she says she shall keep the baby there <i>all</i>
      the time&mdash;the nursery, I mean, not the den. She says she's going to
      teach it to be a quiet baby and hate noise. She says she thinks she can do
      it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; sniffed Aunt Hannah, scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have seen Marie's disgust the other day,&rdquo; went on Billy, a bit
      mischievously. &ldquo;Her Cousin Jane sent on a rattle she'd made herself, all
      soft worsted, with bells inside. It was a dear; but Marie was
      horror-stricken. 'My baby have a rattle?' she cried. 'Why, what would
      Cyril say? As if he could stand a rattle in the house!' And if she didn't
      give that rattle to the janitor's wife that very day, while I was there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; sniffed Aunt Hannah again, as Billy rose to go. &ldquo;Well, I'm
      thinking Marie has still some things to learn in this world&mdash;and
      Cyril, too, for that matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't wonder,&rdquo; laughed Billy, giving Aunt Hannah a good-by kiss.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. PETE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bertram Henshaw had no disquieting forebodings this time concerning his
      portrait of Marguerite Winthrop when the doors of the Bohemian Ten Club
      Exhibition were thrown open to members and invited guests. Just how great
      a popular success it was destined to be, he could not know, of course,
      though he might have suspected it when he began to receive the admiring
      and hearty congratulations of his friends and fellow-artists on that first
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the Winthrop portrait the only jewel in his crown on that
      occasion. His marvelously exquisite &ldquo;The Rose,&rdquo; and his smaller ideal
      picture, &ldquo;Expectation,&rdquo; came in for scarcely less commendation. There was
      no doubt now. The originator of the famous &ldquo;Face of a Girl&rdquo; had come into
      his own again. On all sides this was the verdict, one long-haired critic
      of international fame even claiming openly that Henshaw had not only
      equaled his former best work, but had gone beyond it, in both artistry and
      technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a brilliant gathering. Society, as usual, in costly evening gowns
      and correct swallow-tails rubbed elbows with names famous in the world of
      Art and Letters. Everywhere were gay laughter and sparkling repartee. Even
      the austere-faced J. G. Winthrop unbent to the extent of grim smiles in
      response to the laudatory comments bestowed upon the pictured image of his
      idol, his beautiful daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the great financier's own opinion of the work, no one heard him
      express it except, perhaps, the artist; and all that he got was a grip of
      the hand and a &ldquo;Good! I knew you'd fetch it this time, my boy!&rdquo; But that
      was enough. And, indeed, no one who knew the stern old man needed to more
      than look into his face that evening to know of his entire satisfaction in
      this portrait soon to be the most recent, and the most cherished addition
      to his far-famed art collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Bertram&mdash;Bertram was pleased and happy and gratified, of
      course, as was natural; but he was not one whit more so than was Bertram's
      wife. Billy fairly radiated happiness and proud joy. She told Bertram,
      indeed, that if he did anything to make her any prouder, it would take an
      Annex the size of the Boston Opera House to hold her extra happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh-h, Billy! Some one will hear you,&rdquo; protested Bertram, tragically; but,
      in spite of his horrified voice, he did not look displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Billy met Marguerite Winthrop that evening. At the
      outset there was just a bit of shyness and constraint in the young wife's
      manner. Billy could not forget her old insane jealousy of this beautiful
      girl with the envied name of Marguerite. But it was for only a moment, and
      soon she was her natural, charming self.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Winthrop was fascinated, and she made no pretense of hiding it. She
      even turned to Bertram at last, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, now, Mr. Henshaw, you need never go far for a model! Why don't
      you paint your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy colored. Bertram smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have painted her many times. In fact, I have painted
      her so often that she once declared it was only the tilt of her chin and
      the turn of her head that I loved&mdash;to paint,&rdquo; he said merrily,
      enjoying Billy's pretty confusion, and not realizing that his words really
      distressed her. &ldquo;I have a whole studio full of 'Billys' at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, have you, really?&rdquo; questioned Miss Winthrop, eagerly. &ldquo;Then mayn't I
      see them? Mayn't I, please, Mrs. Henshaw? I'd so love to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course you may,&rdquo; murmured both the artist and his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Then I'm coming right away. May I? I'm going to Washington
      next week, you see. Will you let me come to-morrow at&mdash;at half-past
      three, then? Will it be quite convenient for you, Mrs. Henshaw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite convenient. I shall be glad to see you,&rdquo; smiled Billy. And Bertram
      echoed his wife's cordial permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Then I'll be there at half-past three,&rdquo; nodded Miss Winthrop,
      with a smile, as she turned to give place to an admiring group, who were
      waiting to pay their respects to the artist and his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, after all, that evening, one fly in Billy's ointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fluttered in at the behest of an old acquaintance&mdash;one of the
      &ldquo;advice women,&rdquo; as Billy termed some of her too interested friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they're lovely, perfectly lovely, of course, Mrs. Henshaw,&rdquo; said
      this lady, coming up to say good-night. &ldquo;But, all the same, I'm glad my
      husband is just a plain lawyer. Look out, my dear, that while Mr. Henshaw
      is stealing all those pretty faces for his canvases&mdash;just look out
      that the fair ladies don't turn around and steal his heart before you know
      it. Dear me, but you must be so proud of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; smiled Billy, serenely; and only the jagged split that rent the
      glove on her hand, at that moment, told of the fierce anger behind that
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I couldn't trust Bertram!&rdquo; raged Billy passionately to herself,
      stealing a surreptitious glance at her ruined glove. &ldquo;And as if there
      weren't ever any perfectly happy marriages&mdash;even if you don't ever
      hear of them, or read of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram was not home to luncheon on the day following the opening night of
      the Bohemian Ten Club. A matter of business called him away from the house
      early in the morning; but he told his wife that he surely would be on hand
      for Miss Winthrop's call at half-past three o'clock that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; Billy had urged. &ldquo;I think she's lovely, but you know her so
      much better than I do that I want you here. Besides, you needn't think <i>I'm</i>
      going to show her all those Billys of yours. I may be vain, but I'm not
      quite vain enough for that, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry,&rdquo; her husband had laughed. &ldquo;I'll be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it chanced, however, something occurred an hour before half-past three
      o'clock that drove every thought of Miss Winthrop's call from Billy's
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days, now, Pete had been at the home of his niece in South
      Boston. He had been forced, finally, to give up and go away. News from him
      the day before had been anything but reassuring, and to-day, Bertram being
      gone, Billy had suggested that Eliza serve a simple luncheon and go
      immediately afterward to South Boston to see how her uncle was. This
      suggestion Eliza had followed, leaving the house at one o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after two Calderwell had dropped in to bring Bertram, as he
      expressed it, a bunch of bouquets he had gathered at the picture show the
      night before. He was still in the drawing-room, chatting with Billy, when
      the telephone bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that's Bertram, tell him to come home; he's got company,&rdquo; laughed
      Calderwell, as Billy passed into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he heard Billy give a startled cry, followed by a few
      broken words at short intervals. Then, before he could surmise what had
      happened, she was back in the drawing-room again, her eyes full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Pete,&rdquo; she choked. &ldquo;Eliza says he can't live but a few minutes. He
      wants to see me once more. What shall I do? John's got Peggy out with Aunt
      Hannah and Mrs. Greggory. It was so nice to-day I made them go. But I must
      get there some way&mdash;Pete is calling for me. Uncle William is going,
      and I told Eliza where she might reach Bertram; but what shall <i>I</i>
      do? How shall I go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell was on his feet at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get a taxi. Don't worry&mdash;we'll get there. Poor old soul&mdash;of
      course he wants to see you! Get on your things. I'll have it here in no
      time,&rdquo; he finished, hurrying to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh, I'm so glad I've got <i>you</i> here,&rdquo; sobbed Billy, stumbling
      blindly toward the stairway. &ldquo;I'll be ready in two minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she was; but neither then, nor a little later when she and Calderwell
      drove hurriedly away from the house, did Billy once remember that Miss
      Marguerite Winthrop was coming to call that afternoon to see Mrs. Bertram
      Henshaw and a roomful of Billy pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete was still alive when Calderwell left Billy at the door of the modest
      little home where Eliza's mother lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you're in time, ma'am,&rdquo; sobbed Eliza; &ldquo;and, oh, I'm so glad you've
      come. He's been askin' and askin' for ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From Eliza Billy learned then that Mr. William was there, but not Mr.
      Bertram. They had not been able to reach Mr. Bertram, or Mr. Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy never forgot the look of reverent adoration that came into Pete's
      eyes as she entered the room where he lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Billy&mdash;my Miss Billy! You were so good-to come,&rdquo; he whispered
      faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy choked back a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I'd come, Pete,&rdquo; she said gently, taking one of the thin, worn
      hands into both her soft ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than a few minutes that Pete lived. Four o'clock came, and
      five, and he was still with them. Often he opened his eyes and smiled.
      Sometimes he spoke a low word to William or Billy, or to one of the
      weeping women at the foot of the bed. That the presence of his beloved
      master and mistress meant much to him was plain to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so sorry,&rdquo; he faltered once, &ldquo;about that pretty dress&mdash;I
      spoiled, Miss Billy. But you know&mdash;my hands&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; soothed Billy; &ldquo;but don't worry. It wasn't spoiled,
      Pete. It's all fixed now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm so glad,&rdquo; sighed the sick man. After another long interval of
      silence he turned to William.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them socks&mdash;the medium thin ones&mdash;you'd oughter be puttin' 'em
      on soon, sir, now. They're in the right-hand corner of the bottom drawer&mdash;you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Pete; I'll attend to it,&rdquo; William managed to stammer, after he had
      cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza's turn came next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember about the coffee,&rdquo; Pete said to her, &ldquo;&mdash;the way Mr. William
      likes it. And always eggs, you know, for&mdash;for&mdash;&rdquo; His voice
      trailed into an indistinct murmur, and his eyelids drooped wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the minutes passed. The doctor came and went: there was nothing
      he could do. At half-past five the thin old face became again alight with
      consciousness. There was a good-by message for Bertram, and one for Cyril.
      Aunt Hannah was remembered, and even little Tommy Dunn. Then, gradually, a
      gray shadow crept over the wasted features. The words came more brokenly.
      The mind, plainly, was wandering, for old Pete was young again, and around
      him were the lads he loved, William, Cyril, and Bertram. And then, very
      quietly, soon after the clock struck six, Pete fell into the beginning of
      his long sleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. WHEN BERTRAM CAME HOME
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a little after half-past three o'clock that afternoon when Bertram
      Henshaw hurried up Beacon Street toward his home. He had been delayed, and
      he feared that Miss Winthrop would already have reached the house. Mindful
      of what Billy had said that morning, he knew how his wife would fret if he
      were not there when the guest arrived. The sight of what he surmised to be
      Miss Winthrop's limousine before his door hastened his steps still more.
      But as he reached the house, he was surprised to find Miss Winthrop
      herself turning away from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Winthrop,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you're not going <i>now!</i> You can't
      have been here any&mdash;yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, I&mdash;I haven't,&rdquo; retorted the lady, with heightened color
      and a somewhat peculiar emphasis. &ldquo;My ring wasn't answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't answered!&rdquo; Bertram reddened angrily. &ldquo;Why, what can that mean?
      Where's the maid? Where's my wife? Mrs. Henshaw must be here! She was
      expecting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram, in his annoyed amazement, spoke loudly, vehemently. Hence he was
      quite plainly heard by the group of small boys and girls who had been
      improving the mild weather for a frolic on the sidewalk, and who had been
      attracted to his door a moment before by the shining magnet of the
      Winthrop limousine with its resplendently liveried chauffeur. As Bertram
      spoke, one of the small girls, Bessie Bailey, stepped forward and piped up
      a shrill reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain't, Mr. Henshaw! She ain't here. I saw her go away just a little
      while ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram turned sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw her go away! What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Small Bessie swelled with importance. Bessie was thirteen, in spite of her
      diminutive height. Bessie's mother was dead, and Bessie's caretakers were
      gossiping nurses and servants, who frequently left in her way books that
      were much too old for Bessie to read&mdash;but she read them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean she ain't here&mdash;your wife, Mr. Henshaw. She went away. I saw
      her. I guess likely she's eloped, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eloped!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie swelled still more importantly. To her experienced eyes the
      situation contained all the necessary elements for the customary flight of
      the heroine in her story-books, as here, now, was the irate, deserted
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! And 'twas just before you came&mdash;quite a while before. A big
      shiny black automobile like this drove up&mdash;only it wasn't quite such
      a nice one&mdash;an' Mrs. Henshaw an' a man came out of your house an' got
      in, an' drove right away <i>quick!</i> They just ran to get into it, too&mdash;didn't
      they?&rdquo; She appealed to her young mates grouped about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chorus of shrill exclamations brought Mr. Bertram Henshaw suddenly to
      his senses. By a desperate effort he hid his angry annoyance as he turned
      to the manifestly embarrassed young woman who was already descending the
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Winthrop,&rdquo; he apologized contritely, &ldquo;I'm sure you'll
      forgive this seeming great rudeness on the part of my wife.
      Notwithstanding the lurid tales of our young friends here, I suspect
      nothing more serious has happened than that my wife has been hastily
      summoned to Aunt Hannah, perhaps. Or, of course, she may not have
      understood that you were coming to-day at half-past three&mdash;though I
      thought she did. But I'm so sorry&mdash;when you were so kind as to come&mdash;&rdquo;
       Miss Winthrop interrupted with a quick gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more, I beg of you,&rdquo; she entreated. &ldquo;Mrs. Henshaw is quite
      excusable, I'm sure. Please don't give it another thought,&rdquo; she finished,
      as with a hurried direction to the man who was holding open the door of
      her car, she stepped inside and bowed her good-byes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram, with stern self-control, forced himself to walk nonchalantly up
      his steps, leisurely take out his key, and open his door, under the
      interested eyes of Bessie Bailey and her friends; but once beyond their
      hateful stare, his demeanor underwent a complete change. Throwing aside
      his hat and coat, he strode to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that you, Aunt Hannah?&rdquo; he called crisply, a moment later. &ldquo;Well,
      if Billy's there will you tell her I want to speak to her, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy?&rdquo; answered Aunt Hannah's slow, gentle tones. &ldquo;Why, my dear boy,
      Billy isn't here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She isn't? Well, when did she leave? She's been there, hasn't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don't think so, but I'll see, if you like. Mrs. Greggory and I
      have just this minute come in from an automobile ride. We would have
      stayed longer, but it began to get chilly, and I forgot to take one of the
      shawls that I'd laid out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; well, if you will see, please, if Billy has been there, and when she
      left,&rdquo; said Bertram, with grim self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'll see,&rdquo; murmured Aunt Hannah. In a few moments her voice
      again sounded across the wires. &ldquo;Why, no, Bertram, Rosa says she hasn't
      been here since yesterday. Isn't she there somewhere about the house?
      Didn't you know where she was going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, I didn't&mdash;else I shouldn't have been asking you,&rdquo; snapped
      the irate Bertram and hung up the receiver with most rude haste, thereby
      cutting off an astounded &ldquo;Oh, my grief and conscience!&rdquo; in the middle of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next ten minutes Bertram spent in going through the whole house, from
      garret to basement. Needless to say, he found nothing to enlighten him, or
      to soothe his temper. Four o'clock came, then half-past, and five. At five
      Bertram began to look for Eliza, but in vain. At half-past five he watched
      for William; but William, too, did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram was pacing the floor now, nervously. He was a little frightened,
      but more mortified and angry. That Billy should have allowed Miss Winthrop
      to call by appointment only to find no hostess, no message, no maid, even,
      to answer her ring&mdash;it was inexcusable! Impulsiveness,
      unconventionality, and girlish irresponsibility were all very delightful,
      of course&mdash;at times; but not now, certainly. Billy was not a girl any
      longer. She was a married woman. <i>Something</i> was due to him, her
      husband! A pretty picture he must have made on those steps, trying to
      apologize for a truant wife, and to laugh off that absurd Bessie Bailey's
      preposterous assertion at the same time! What would Miss Winthrop think?
      What could she think? Bertram fairly ground his teeth with chagrin, at the
      situation in which he found himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were matters helped any by the fact that Bertram was hungry. Bertram's
      luncheon had been meager and unsatisfying. That the kitchen down-stairs
      still remained in silent, spotless order instead of being astir with the
      sounds and smells of a good dinner (as it should have been) did not
      improve his temper. Where Billy was he could not imagine. He thought, once
      or twice, of calling up some of her friends; but something held him back
      from that&mdash;though he did try to get Marie, knowing very well that she
      was probably over to the new house and would not answer. He was not
      surprised, therefore, when he received no reply to his ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      That there was the slightest truth in Bessie Bailey's absurd &ldquo;elopement&rdquo;
       idea, Bertram did not, of course, for an instant believe. The only thing
      that rankled about that was the fact that she had suggested such a thing,
      and that Miss Winthrop and those silly children had heard her. He
      recognized half of Bessie's friends as neighborhood youngsters, and he
      knew very well that there would be many a quiet laugh at his expense
      around various Beacon Street dinner-tables that night. At the thought of
      those dinner-tables, he scowled again. <i>He</i> had no dinner-table&mdash;at
      least, he had no dinner on it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Who the man might be Bertram thought he could easily guess. It was either
      Arkwright or Calderwell, of course; and probably that tiresome Alice
      Greggory was mixed up in it somehow. He did wish Billy&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Six o'clock came, then half-past. Bertram was indeed frightened now, but
      he was more angry, and still more hungry. He had, in fact, reached that
      state of blind unreasonableness said to be peculiar to hungry males from
      time immemorial.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten minutes of seven a key clicked in the lock of the outer door, and
      William and Billy entered the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost dark. Bertram could not see their faces. He had not lighted
      the hall at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began sharply, &ldquo;is this the way you receive your callers,
      Billy? I came home and found Miss Winthrop just leaving&mdash;no one here
      to receive her! Where've you been? Where's Eliza? Where's my dinner? Of
      course I don't mean to scold, Billy, but there is a limit to even my
      patience&mdash;and it's reached now. I can't help suggesting that if you
      would tend to your husband and your home a little more, and go
      gallivanting off with Calderwell and Arkwright and Alice Greggory a little
      less, that&mdash;Where is Eliza, anyway?&rdquo; he finished irritably, switching
      on the lights with a snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of dead silence. At Bertram's first words Billy and
      William had stopped short. Neither had moved since. Now William turned and
      began to speak, but Billy interrupted. She met her husband's gaze
      steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be down at once to get your dinner,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Eliza will
      not come to-night. Pete is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram started forward with a quick cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead! Oh, Billy! Then you were&mdash;<i>there!</i> Billy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his wife did not apparently hear him. She passed him without turning
      her head, and went on up the stairs, leaving him to meet the sorrowful,
      accusing eyes of William.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. AFTER THE STORM
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young husband's apologies were profuse and abject. Bertram was
      heartily ashamed of himself, and was man enough to acknowledge it. Almost
      on his knees he begged Billy to forgive him; and in a frenzy of
      self-denunciation he followed her down into the kitchen that night,
      piteously beseeching her to speak to him, to just <i>look</i> at him,
      even, so that he might know he was not utterly despised&mdash;though he
      did, indeed, deserve to be more than despised, he moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Billy did not speak, or even vouchsafe a glance in his direction.
      Very quietly she went about her preparations for a simple meal, paying
      apparently no more attention to Bertram than as if he were not there. But
      that her ears were only seemingly, and not really deaf, was shown very
      clearly a little later, when, at a particularly abject wail on the part of
      the babbling shadow at her heels, Billy choked into a little gasp, half
      laughter, half sob. It was all over then. Bertram had her in his arms in a
      twinkling, while to the floor clattered and rolled a knife and a
      half-peeled baked potato.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, after that, there could be no more dignified silences on the
      part of the injured wife. There were, instead, half-smiles, tears, sobs, a
      tremulous telling of Pete's going and his messages, followed by a tearful
      listening to Bertram's story of the torture he had endured at the hands of
      Miss Winthrop, Bessie Bailey, and an empty, dinnerless house. And thus, in
      one corner of the kitchen, some time later, a hungry, desperate William
      found them, the half-peeled, cold baked potato still at their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Torn between his craving for food and his desire not to interfere with any
      possible peace-making, William was obviously hesitating what to do, when
      Billy glanced up and saw him. She saw, too, at the same time, the empty,
      blazing gas-stove burner, and the pile of half-prepared potatoes, to warm
      which the burner had long since been lighted. With a little cry she broke
      away from her husband's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! and here's poor Uncle William, bless his heart, with not a thing
      to eat yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all got dinner then, together, with many a sigh and quick-coming tear
      as everywhere they met some sad reminder of the gentle old hands that
      would never again minister to their comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a silent meal, and little, after all, was eaten, though brave
      attempts at cheerfulness and naturalness were made by all three. Bertram,
      especially, talked, and tried to make sure that the shadow on Billy's face
      was at least not the one his own conduct had brought there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you do&mdash;you surely do forgive me, don't you?&rdquo; he begged, as he
      followed her into the kitchen after the sorry meal was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, dear, yes,&rdquo; sighed Billy, trying to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you'll forget?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy! And you'll forget?&rdquo; Bertram's voice was insistent, reproachful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy changed color and bit her lip. She looked plainly distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy!&rdquo; cried the man, still more reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Bertram, I can't forget&mdash;quite yet,&rdquo; faltered Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram frowned. For a minute he looked as if he were about to take up the
      matter seriously and argue it with her; but the next moment he smiled and
      tossed his head with jaunty playfulness&mdash;Bertram, to tell the truth,
      had now had quite enough of what he privately termed &ldquo;scenes&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;heroics&rdquo;; and, manlike, he was very ardently longing for the old
      easy-going friendliness, with all unpleasantness banished to oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you'll have to forget,&rdquo; he claimed, with cheery insistence, &ldquo;for
      you've promised to forgive me&mdash;and one can't forgive without
      forgetting. So, there!&rdquo; he finished, with a smilingly determined
      &ldquo;now-everything-is-just-as-it-was-before&rdquo; air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy made no response. She turned hurriedly and began to busy herself
      with the dishes at the sink. In her heart she was wondering: could she
      ever forget what Bertram had said? Would anything ever blot out those
      awful words: &ldquo;If you would tend to your husband and your home a little
      more, and go gallivanting off with Calderwell and Arkwright and Alice
      Greggory a little less&mdash;&ldquo;? It seemed now that always, for evermore,
      they would ring in her ears; always, for evermore, they would burn deeper
      and deeper into her soul. And not once, in all Bertram's apologies, had he
      referred to them&mdash;those words he had uttered. He had not said he did
      not mean them. He had not said he was sorry he spoke them. He had ignored
      them; and he expected that now she, too, would ignore them. As if she
      could!&rdquo; If you would tend to your husband and your home a little more, and
      go gallivanting off with Calderwell and Arkwright and Alice Greggory a
      little less&mdash;&rdquo; Oh, if only she could, indeed,&mdash;forget!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Billy went up-stairs that night she ran across her &ldquo;Talk to Young
      Wives&rdquo; in her desk. With a half-stifled cry she thrust it far back out of
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate you, I hate you&mdash;with all your old talk about 'brushing up
      against outside interests'!&rdquo; she whispered fiercely. &ldquo;Well, I've 'brushed'&mdash;and
      now see what I've got for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later, however, after Bertram was asleep, Billy crept out of bed and got
      the book. Under the carefully shaded lamp in the adjoining room she turned
      the pages softly till she came to the sentence: &ldquo;Perhaps it would be hard
      to find a more utterly unreasonable, irritable, irresponsible creature
      than a hungry man.&rdquo; With a long sigh she began to read; and not until some
      minutes later did she close the book, turn off the light, and steal back
      to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next three days, until after the funeral at the shabby little
      South Boston house, Eliza spent only about half of each day at the Strata.
      This, much to her distress, left many of the household tasks for her young
      mistress to perform. Billy, however, attacked each new duty with a
      feverish eagerness that seemed to make the performance of it very like
      some glad penance done for past misdeeds. And when&mdash;on the day after
      they had laid the old servant in his last resting place&mdash;a despairing
      message came from Eliza to the effect that now her mother was very ill,
      and would need her care, Billy promptly told Eliza to stay as long as was
      necessary; that they could get along all right without her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Billy, what <i>are</i> we going to do?&rdquo; Bertram demanded, when he
      heard the news. &ldquo;We must have somebody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I'm</i> going to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! As if you could!&rdquo; scoffed Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy lifted her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't I, indeed,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Do you realize, young man, how much
      I've done the last three days? How about those muffins you had this
      morning for breakfast, and that cake last night? And didn't you yourself
      say that you never ate a better pudding than that date puff yesterday
      noon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram laughed and shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear love, I'm not questioning your <i>ability</i> to do it,&rdquo; he
      soothed quickly. &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he added, with a whimsical smile, &ldquo;I must remind
      you that Eliza has been here half the time, and that muffins and date
      puffs, however delicious, aren't all there is to running a big house like
      this. Besides, just be sensible, Billy,&rdquo; he went on more seriously, as he
      noted the rebellious gleam coming into his young wife's eyes; &ldquo;you'd know
      you couldn't do it, if you'd just stop to think. There's the Carletons
      coming to dinner Monday, and my studio Tea to-morrow, to say nothing of
      the Symphony and the opera, and the concerts you'd lose because you were
      too dead tired to go to them. You know how it was with that concert
      yesterday afternoon which Alice Greggory wanted you to go to with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't&mdash;want&mdash;to go,&rdquo; choked Billy, under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there's your music. You haven't done a thing with that for days, yet
      only last week you told me the publishers were hurrying you for that last
      song to complete the group.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't felt like&mdash;writing,&rdquo; stammered Billy, still half under her
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you haven't,&rdquo; triumphed Bertram. &ldquo;You've been too dead tired.
      And that's just what I say. Billy, you <i>can't</i> do it all yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to. I want to&mdash;to tend to things,&rdquo; faltered Billy, with a
      half-fearful glance into her husband's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy was hearing very loudly now that accusing &ldquo;If you'd tend to your
      husband and your home a little more&mdash;&rdquo; Bertram, however, was not
      hearing it, evidently. Indeed, he seemed never to have heard it&mdash;much
      less to have spoken it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tend to things,'&rdquo; he laughed lightly. &ldquo;Well, you'll have enough to do to
      tend to the maid, I fancy. Anyhow, we're going to have one. I'll just step
      into one of those&mdash;what do you call 'em?&mdash;intelligence offices
      on my way down and send one up,&rdquo; he finished, as he gave his wife a
      good-by kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Billy, struggling with the broom and the drawing-room
      carpet, was called to the telephone. It was her husband's voice that came
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, for heaven's sake, take pity on me. Won't you put on your duds and
      come and engage your maid yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Bertram, what's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter? Holy smoke! Well, I've been to three of those intelligence
      offices&mdash;though why they call them that I can't imagine. If ever
      there was a place utterly devoid of intelligence-but never mind! I've
      interviewed four fat ladies, two thin ones, and one medium with a wart.
      I've cheerfully divulged all our family secrets, promised every other
      half-hour out, and taken oath that our household numbers three adult
      members, and no more; but I simply <i>can't</i> remember how many
      handkerchiefs we have in the wash each week. Billy, will you come? Maybe
      you can do something with them. I'm sure you can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course I'll come,&rdquo; chirped Billy. &ldquo;Where shall I meet you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram gave the street and number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! I'll be there,&rdquo; promised Billy, as she hung up the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite forgetting the broom in the middle of the drawing-room floor, Billy
      tripped up-stairs to change her dress. On her lips was a gay little song.
      In her heart was joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather guess <i>now</i> I'm tending to my husband and my home!&rdquo; she was
      crowing to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Billy was about to leave the house the telephone bell jangled
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Alice Greggory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, dear,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;can't you come out? Mr. Arkwright and Mr.
      Calderwell are here, and they've brought some new music. We want you. Will
      you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't, dear. Bertram wants me. He's sent for me. I've got some <i>housewifely</i>
      duties to perform to-day,&rdquo; returned Billy, in a voice so curiously
      triumphant that Alice, at her end of the wires, frowned in puzzled wonder
      as she turned away from the telephone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. INTO TRAINING FOR MARY ELLEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bertram told a friend afterwards that he never knew the meaning of the
      word &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; until he had seen the Strata during the weeks immediately
      following the laying away of his old servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every stratum was aquiver with apprehension,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;and there was
      never any telling when the next grand upheaval would rock the whole
      structure to its foundations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Bertram so far from being right. It was, indeed, a chaos, as none
      knew better than did Bertram's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Billy! Sorry indeed were these days for Billy; and, as if to make her
      cup of woe full to overflowing, there were Sister Kate's epistolary &ldquo;I
      told you so,&rdquo; and Aunt Hannah's ever recurring lament: &ldquo;If only, Billy,
      you were a practical housekeeper yourself, they wouldn't impose on you
      so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah, to be sure, offered Rosa, and Kate, by letter, offered advice&mdash;plenty
      of it. But Billy, stung beyond all endurance, and fairly radiating hurt
      pride and dogged determination, disdained all assistance, and, with head
      held high, declared she was getting along very well, very well indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was the way she &ldquo;got along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First came Nora. Nora was a blue-eyed, black-haired Irish girl, the sixth
      that the despairing Billy had interviewed on that fateful morning when
      Bertram had summoned her to his aid. Nora stayed two days. During her
      reign the entire Strata echoed to banged doors, dropped china, and slammed
      furniture. At her departure the Henshaws' possessions were less by four
      cups, two saucers, one plate, one salad bowl, two cut glass tumblers, and
      a teapot&mdash;the latter William's choicest bit of Lowestoft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olga came next. Olga was a Treasure. She was low-voiced, gentle-eyed, and
      a good cook. She stayed a week. By that time the growing frequency of the
      disappearance of sundry small articles of value and convenience led to
      Billy's making a reluctant search of Olga's room&mdash;and to Olga's
      departure; for the room was, indeed, a treasure house, the Treasure having
      gathered unto itself other treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following Olga came a period of what Bertram called &ldquo;one night stands,&rdquo; so
      frequently were the dramatis personæ below stairs changed. Gretchen drank.
      Christine knew only four words of English: salt, good-by, no, and yes; and
      Billy found need occasionally of using other words. Mary was impertinent
      and lazy. Jennie could not even boil a potato properly, much less cook a
      dinner. Sarah (colored) was willing and pleasant, but insufferably untidy.
      Bridget was neatness itself, but she had no conception of the value of
      time. Her meals were always from thirty to sixty minutes late, and
      half-cooked at that. Vera sang&mdash;when she wasn't whistling&mdash;and
      as she was generally off the key, and always off the tune, her almost
      frantic mistress dismissed her before twenty-four hours had passed. Then
      came Mary Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ellen began well. She was neat, capable, and obliging; but it did not
      take her long to discover just how much&mdash;and how little&mdash;her
      mistress really knew of practical housekeeping. Matters and things were
      very different then. Mary Ellen became argumentative, impertinent, and
      domineering. She openly shirked her work, when it pleased her so to do,
      and demanded perquisites and privileges so insolently that even William
      asked Billy one day whether Mary Ellen or Billy herself were the mistress
      of the Strata: and Bertram, with mock humility, inquired how <i>soon</i>
      Mary Ellen would be wanting the house. Billy, in weary despair, submitted
      to this bullying for almost a week; then, in a sudden accession of
      outraged dignity that left Mary Ellen gasping with surprise, she told the
      girl to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus the days passed. The maids came and the maids went, and, to
      Billy, each one seemed a little worse than the one before. Nowhere was
      there comfort, rest, or peacefulness. The nights were a torture of
      apprehension, and the days an even greater torture of fulfilment. Noise,
      confusion, meals poorly cooked and worse served, dust, disorder, and
      uncertainty. And this was <i>home</i>, Billy told herself bitterly. No
      wonder that Bertram telephoned more and more frequently that he had met a
      friend, and was dining in town. No wonder that William pushed back his
      plate almost every meal with his food scarcely touched, and then wandered
      about the house with that hungry, homesick, homeless look that nearly
      broke her heart. No wonder, indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it had come. It was true. Aunt Hannah and Kate and the &ldquo;Talk to
      Young Wives&rdquo; were right. She had not been fit to marry Bertram. She had
      not been fit to marry anybody. Her honeymoon was not only waning, but
      going into a total eclipse. Had not Bertram already declared that if she
      would tend to her husband and her home a little more&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy clenched her small hands and set her round chin squarely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well, she would show them. She would tend to her husband and her
      home. She fancied she could <i>learn</i> to run that house, and run it
      well! And forthwith she descended to the kitchen and told the then
      reigning tormentor that her wages would be paid until the end of the week,
      but that her services would be immediately dispensed with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy was well aware now that housekeeping was a matter of more than
      muffins and date puffs. She could gauge, in a measure, the magnitude of
      the task to which she had set herself. But she did not falter; and very
      systematically she set about making her plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a good stout woman to come in twice a week for the heavier work, she
      believed she could manage by herself very well until Eliza could come
      back. At least she could serve more palatable meals than the most of those
      that had appeared lately; and at least she could try to make a home that
      would not drive Bertram to club dinners, and Uncle William to hungry
      wanderings from room to room. Meanwhile, all the time, she could be
      learning, and in due course she would reach that shining goal of
      Housekeeping Efficiency, short of which&mdash;according to Aunt Hannah and
      the &ldquo;Talk to Young Wives&rdquo;&mdash;no woman need hope for a waneless
      honeymoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      So chaotic and erratic had been the household service, and so quietly did
      Billy slip into her new role, that it was not until the second meal after
      the maid's departure that the master of the house discovered what had
      happened. Then, as his wife rose to get some forgotten article, he
      questioned, with uplifted eyebrows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too good to wait upon us, is my lady now, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lady is waiting on you,&rdquo; smiled Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see <i>this</i> lady is,&rdquo; retorted Bertram, grimly; &ldquo;but I mean
      our real lady in the kitchen. Great Scott, Billy, how long are you going
      to stand this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy tossed her head airily, though she shook in her shoes. Billy had
      been dreading this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not standing it. She's gone,&rdquo; responded Billy, cheerfully, resuming
      her seat. &ldquo;Uncle William, sha'n't I give you some more pudding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone, so soon?&rdquo; groaned Bertram, as William passed his plate, with a
      smiling nod. &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; went on Bertram, resignedly, &ldquo;she stayed longer
      than the last one. When is the next one coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's already here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here? But&mdash;you served the dessert, and&mdash;&rdquo; At something in
      Billy's face, a quick suspicion came into his own. &ldquo;Billy, you don't mean
      that you&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she nodded brightly, &ldquo;that's just what I mean. I'm the next one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exploded Bertram, wrathfully. &ldquo;Oh, come, Billy, we've been all
      over this before. You know I can't have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can. You've got to have it,&rdquo; retorted Billy, still with that
      disarming, airy cheerfulness. &ldquo;Besides, 'twon't be half so bad as you
      think. Wasn't that a good pudding to-night? Didn't you both come back for
      more? Well, I made it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puddings!&rdquo; ejaculated Bertram, with an impatient gesture. &ldquo;Billy, as I've
      said before, it takes something besides puddings to run this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know it does,&rdquo; dimpled Billy, &ldquo;and I've got Mrs. Durgin for that
      part. She's coming twice a week, and more, if I need her. Why, dearie, you
      don't know anything about how comfortable you're going to be! I'll leave
      it to Uncle William if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Uncle William had gone. Silently he had slipped from his chair and
      disappeared. Uncle William, it might be mentioned in passing, had never
      quite forgotten Aunt Hannah's fateful call with its dire revelations
      concerning a certain unwanted, superfluous, third-party husband's brother.
      Remembering this, there were times when he thought absence was both safest
      and best. This was one of the times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Billy, dear,&rdquo; still argued Bertram, irritably, &ldquo;how can you? You
      don't know how. You've had no experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy threw back her shoulders. An ominous light came to her eyes. She was
      no longer airily playful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's exactly it, Bertram. I don't know how&mdash;but I'm going to
      learn. I haven't had experience&mdash;but I'm going to get it. I <i>can't</i>
      make a worse mess of it than we've had ever since Eliza went, anyway!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you'd get a maid&mdash;a good maid,&rdquo; persisted Bertram, feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had <i>one</i>&mdash;Mary Ellen. She was a good maid&mdash;until she
      found out how little her mistress knew; then&mdash;well, you know what it
      was then. Do you think I'd let that thing happen to me again? No, sir! I'm
      going into training for&mdash;my next Mary Ellen!&rdquo; And with a very
      majestic air Billy rose from the table and began to clear away the dishes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. THE EFFICIENCY STAR&mdash;AND BILLY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Billy was not a young woman that did things by halves. Long ago, in the
      days of her childhood, her Aunt Ella had once said of her: &ldquo;If only Billy
      didn't go into things all over, so; but whether it's measles or mud pies,
      I always know that she'll be the measliest or the muddiest of any child in
      town!&rdquo; It could not be expected, therefore, that Billy would begin to play
      her new rôle now with any lack of enthusiasm. But even had she needed any
      incentive, there was still ever ringing in her ears Bertram's accusing:
      &ldquo;If you'd tend to your husband and your home a little more&mdash;&rdquo; Billy
      still declared very emphatically that she had forgiven Bertram; but she
      knew, in her heart, that she had not forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, as the days passed, it could not be said that Billy was not
      tending to her husband and her home. From morning till night, now, she
      tended to nothing else. She seldom touched her piano&mdash;save to dust it&mdash;and
      she never touched her half-finished song-manuscript, long since banished
      to the oblivion of the music cabinet. She made no calls except occasional
      flying visits to the Annex, or to the pretty new home where Marie and
      Cyril were now delightfully settled. The opera and the Symphony were over
      for the season, but even had they not been, Billy could not have attended
      them. She had no time. Surely she was not doing any &ldquo;gallivanting&rdquo; now,
      she told herself sometimes, a little aggrievedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, indeed, no time. From morning until night Billy was busy,
      flying from one task to another. Her ambition to have everything just
      right was equalled only by her dogged determination to &ldquo;just show them&rdquo;
       that she could do this thing. At first, of course, hampered as she was by
      ignorance and inexperience, each task consumed about twice as much time as
      was necessary. Yet afterwards, when accustomedness had brought its reward
      of speed, there was still for Billy no time; for increased knowledge had
      only opened the way to other paths, untrodden and alluring. Study of
      cookbooks had led to the study of food values. Billy discovered suddenly
      that potatoes, beef, onions, oranges, and puddings were something besides
      vegetables, meat, fruit, and dessert. They possessed attributes known as
      proteids, fats, and carbohydrates. Faint memories of long forgotten school
      days hinted that these terms had been heard before; but never, Billy was
      sure, had she fully realized what they meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this juncture that Billy ran across a book entitled &ldquo;Correct
      Eating for Efficiency.&rdquo; She bought it at once, and carried it home in
      triumph. It proved to be a marvelous book. Billy had not read two chapters
      before she began to wonder how the family had managed to live thus far
      with any sort of success, in the face of their dense ignorance and her own
      criminal carelessness concerning their daily bill of fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner that night Billy told Bertram and William of her discovery, and,
      with growing excitement, dilated on the wonderful good that it was to
      bring to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you don't know, you can't imagine what a treasure it is!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;It gives a complete table for the exact balancing of food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; demanded Bertram, glancing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The exact balancing of food; and this book says that's the biggest
      problem that modern scientists have to solve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; shrugged Bertram. &ldquo;Well, you just balance my food to my hunger,
      and I'll agree not to complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but, Bertram, it's serious, really,&rdquo; urged Billy, looking genuinely
      distressed. &ldquo;Why, it says that what you eat goes to make up what you are.
      It makes your vital energies. Your brain power and your body power come
      from what you eat. Don't you see? If you're going to paint a picture you
      need something different from what you would if you were going to&mdash;to
      saw wood; and what this book tells is&mdash;is what I ought to give you to
      make you do each one, I should think, from what I've read so far. Now
      don't you see how important it is? What if I should give you the saw-wood
      kind of a breakfast when you were just going up-stairs to paint all day?
      And what if I should give Uncle William a&mdash;a soldier's breakfast when
      all he is going to do is to go down on State Street and sit still all
      day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but, my dear,&rdquo; began Uncle William, looking slightly worried,
      &ldquo;there's my eggs that I <i>always</i> have, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven's sake, Billy, what <i>have</i> you got hold of now?&rdquo; demanded
      Bertram, with just a touch of irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose I didn't sound very logical,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;But the book&mdash;you
      just wait. It's in the kitchen. I'm going to get it.&rdquo; And with laughing
      eagerness she ran from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment she had returned, book in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen. <i>This</i> is the real thing&mdash;not my garbled
      inaccuracies. 'The food which we eat serves three purposes: it builds the
      body substance, bone, muscle, etc., it produces heat in the body, and it
      generates vital energy. Nitrogen in different chemical combinations
      contributes largely to the manufacture of body substances; the fats
      produce heat; and the starches and sugars go to make the vital energy. The
      nitrogenous food elements we call proteins; the fats and oils, fats; and
      the starches and sugars (because of the predominance of carbon), we call
      carbohydrates. Now in selecting the diet for the day you should take care
      to choose those foods which give the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in
      just the right proportion.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Billy!&rdquo; groaned Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's so, Bertram,&rdquo; maintained Billy, anxiously. &ldquo;And it's every bit
      here. I don't have to guess at it at all. They even give the quantities of
      calories of energy required for different sized men. I'm going to measure
      you both to-morrow; and you must be weighed, too,&rdquo; she continued, ignoring
      the sniffs of remonstrance from her two listeners. &ldquo;Then I'll know just
      how many calories to give each of you. They say a man of average size and
      weight, and sedentary occupation, should have at least 2,000 calories&mdash;and
      some authorities say 3,000&mdash;in this proportion: proteins, 300
      calories, fats, 350 calories, carbohydrates, 1,350 calories. But you both
      are taller than five feet five inches, and I should think you weighed more
      than 145 pounds; so I can't tell just yet how many calories you will
      need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many we will need, indeed!&rdquo; ejaculated Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear, you know I have to have my eggs,&rdquo; began Uncle William
      again, in a worried voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you do, dear; and you shall have them,&rdquo; soothed Billy,
      brightly. &ldquo;It's only that I'll have to be careful and balance up the other
      things for the day accordingly. Don't you see? Now listen. We'll see what
      eggs are.&rdquo; She turned the leaves rapidly. &ldquo;Here's the food table. It's
      lovely. It tells everything. I never saw anything so wonderful. A&mdash;b&mdash;c&mdash;d&mdash;e&mdash;here
      we are. 'Eggs, scrambled or boiled, fats and proteins, one egg, 100.' If
      it's poached it's only 50; but you like yours boiled, so we'll have to
      reckon on the 100. And you always have two, so that means 200 calories in
      fats and proteins. Now, don't you see? If you can't have but 300 proteins
      and 350 fats all day, and you've already eaten 200 in your two eggs,
      that'll leave just&mdash;er&mdash;450 for all the rest of the day,&mdash;of
      fats and proteins, you understand. And you've no idea how fast that'll
      count up. Why, just one serving of butter is 100 of fats, and eight
      almonds is another, while a serving of lentils is 100 of proteins. So you
      see how it'll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; murmured Uncle William, casting a mournful glance about the
      generously laden table, much as if he were bidding farewell to a departing
      friend. &ldquo;But if I should want more to eat&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped helplessly,
      and Bertram's aggrieved voice filled the pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Billy, if you think I'm going to be measured for an egg and
      weighed for an almond, you're much mistaken; because I'm not. I want to
      eat what I like, and as much as I like, whether it's six calories or six
      thousand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy chuckled, but she raised her hands in pretended shocked protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six thousand! Mercy! Bertram, I don't know what would happen if you ate
      that quantity; but I'm sure you couldn't paint. You'd just have to saw
      wood and dig ditches to use up all that vital energy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; scoffed Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, this is for <i>efficiency</i>,&rdquo; went on Billy, with an earnest
      air. &ldquo;This man owns up that some may think a 2,000 calory ration is
      altogether too small, and he advises such to begin with 3,000 or even
      3,500&mdash;graded, of course, according to a man's size, weight, and
      occupation. But he says one famous man does splendid work on only 1,800
      calories, and another on even 1,600. But that is just a matter of chewing.
      Why, Bertram, you have no idea what perfectly wonderful things chewing
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've heard of that,&rdquo; grunted Bertram; &ldquo;ten chews to a cherry, and
      sixty to a spoonful of soup. There's an old metronome up-stairs that Cyril
      left. You might bring it down and set it going on the table&mdash;so many
      ticks to a mouthful, I suppose. I reckon, with an incentive like that to
      eat, just about two calories would do me. Eh, William?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram! Now you're only making fun,&rdquo; chided Billy; &ldquo;and when it's really
      serious, too. Now listen,&rdquo; she admonished, picking up the book again. &ldquo;'If
      a man consumes a large amount of meat, and very few vegetables, his diet
      will be too rich in protein, and too lacking in carbohydrates. On the
      other hand, if he consumes great quantities of pastry, bread, butter, and
      tea, his meals will furnish too much energy, and not enough building
      material.' There, Bertram, don't you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I see,&rdquo; teased Bertram. &ldquo;William, better eat what you can
      to-night. I foresee it's the last meal of just <i>food</i> we'll get for
      some time. Hereafter we'll have proteins, fats, and carbohydrates made
      into calory croquettes, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram!&rdquo; scolded Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bertram would not be silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, just let me take that book,&rdquo; he insisted, dragging the volume from
      Billy's reluctant fingers. &ldquo;Now, William, listen. Here's your breakfast
      to-morrow morning: strawberries, 100 calories; whole-wheat bread, 75
      calories; butter, 100 calories (no second helping, mind you, or you'd ruin
      the balance and something would topple); boiled eggs, 200 calories; cocoa,
      100 calories&mdash;which all comes to 570 calories. Sounds like an English
      bill of fare with a new kind of foreign money, but 'tisn't, really, you
      know. Now for luncheon you can have tomato soup, 50 calories; potato salad&mdash;that's
      cheap, only 30 calories, and&mdash;&rdquo; But Billy pulled the book away then,
      and in righteous indignation carried it to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't deserve anything to eat,&rdquo; she declared with dignity, as she
      returned to the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; queried Bertram, his eyebrows uplifted. &ldquo;Well, as near as I can make
      out we aren't going to get&mdash;much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Billy did not deign to answer this.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of Bertram's tormenting gibes, Billy did, for some days, arrange
      her meals in accordance with the wonderful table of food given in &ldquo;Correct
      Eating for Efficiency.&rdquo; To be sure, Bertram, whatever he found before him
      during those days, anxiously asked whether he were eating fats, proteins,
      or carbohydrates; and he worried openly as to the possibility of his
      meal's producing one calory too much or too little, thus endangering his
      &ldquo;balance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy alternately laughed and scolded, to the unvarying good nature of her
      husband. As it happened, however, even this was not for long, for Billy
      ran across a magazine article on food adulteration; and this so filled her
      with terror lest, in the food served, she were killing her family by slow
      poison, that she forgot all about the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.
      Her talk these days was of formaldehyde, benzoate of soda, and salicylic
      acid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon, too, Billy discovered an exclusive Back Bay school for
      instruction in household economics and domestic hygiene. Billy
      investigated it at once, and was immediately aflame with enthusiasm. She
      told Bertram that it taught everything, <i>everything</i> she wanted to
      know; and forthwith she enrolled herself as one of its most devoted
      pupils, in spite of her husband's protests that she knew enough, more than
      enough, already. This school attendance, to her consternation, Billy
      discovered took added time; but in some way she contrived to find it to
      take.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the days passed. Eliza's mother, though better, was still too ill
      for her daughter to leave her. Billy, as the warm weather approached,
      began to look pale and thin. Billy, to tell the truth, was working
      altogether too hard; but she would not admit it, even to herself. At first
      the novelty of the work, and her determination to conquer at all costs,
      had given a fictitious strength to her endurance. Now that the novelty had
      become accustomedness, and the conquering a surety, Billy discovered that
      she had a back that could ache, and limbs that, at times, could almost
      refuse to move from weariness. There was still, however, one spur that
      never failed to urge her to fresh endeavor, and to make her, at least
      temporarily, forget both ache and weariness; and that was the comforting
      thought that now, certainly, even Bertram himself must admit that she was
      tending to her home and her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Bertram&mdash;Bertram, it is true, had at first uttered frequent and
      vehement protests against his wife's absorption of both mind and body in
      &ldquo;that plaguy housework,&rdquo; as he termed it. But as the days passed, and
      blessed order superseded chaos, peace followed discord, and delicious,
      well-served meals took the place of the horrors that had been called meals
      in the past, he gradually accepted the change with tranquil satisfaction,
      and forgot to question how it was brought about; though he did still,
      sometimes, rebel because Billy was always too tired, or too busy, to go
      out with him. Of late, however, he had not done even this so frequently,
      for a new &ldquo;Face of a Girl&rdquo; had possessed his soul; and all his thoughts
      and most of his time had gone to putting on canvas the vision of
      loveliness that his mind's eye saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      By June fifteenth the picture was finished. Bertram awoke then to his
      surroundings. He found summer was upon him with no plans made for its
      enjoyment. He found William had started West for a two weeks' business
      trip. But what he did not find one day&mdash;at least at first&mdash;was
      his wife, when he came home unexpectedly at four o'clock. And Bertram
      especially wanted to find his wife that day, for he had met three people
      whose words had disquieted him not a little. First, Aunt Hannah. She had
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram, where is Billy? She hasn't been out to the Annex for a week; and
      the last time she was there she looked sick. I was real worried about
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cyril had been next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Billy?&rdquo; he had asked abruptly. &ldquo;Marie says she hasn't seen her
      for two weeks. Marie's afraid she's sick. She says Billy didn't look well
      a bit, when she did see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell had capped the climax. He had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott, Henshaw, where have you been keeping yourself? And where's
      your wife? Not one of us has caught more than a glimpse of her for weeks.
      She hasn't sung with us, nor played for us, nor let us take her anywhere
      for a month of Sundays. Even Miss Greggory says <i>she</i> hasn't seen
      much of her, and that Billy always says she's too busy to go anywhere. But
      Miss Greggory says she looks pale and thin, and that <i>she</i> thinks
      she's worrying too much over running the house. I hope she isn't sick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, Billy isn't sick. Billy's all right,&rdquo; Bertram had answered. He
      had spoken lightly, nonchalantly, with an elaborate air of carelessness;
      but after he had left Calderwell, he had turned his steps abruptly and a
      little hastily toward home.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had not found Billy&mdash;at least, not at once. He had gone first
      down into the kitchen and dining-room. He remembered then, uneasily, that
      he had always looked for Billy in the kitchen and dining-room, of late.
      To-day, however, she was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the kitchen table Bertram did see a book wide open, and, mechanically,
      he picked it up. It was a much-thumbed cookbook, and it was open where two
      once-blank pages bore his wife's handwriting. On the first page, under the
      printed heading &ldquo;Things to Remember,&rdquo; he read these sentences:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That rice swells till every dish in the house is full, and that spinach
      shrinks till you can't find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That beets boil dry if you look out the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That biscuits which look as if they'd been mixed up with a rusty stove
      poker haven't really been so, but have only got too much undissolved soda
      in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were other sentences, but Bertram's eyes chanced to fall on the
      opposite page where the &ldquo;Things to Remember&rdquo; had been changed to &ldquo;Things
      to Forget&rdquo;; and here Billy had written just four words: &ldquo;Burns,&rdquo; &ldquo;cuts,&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;yesterday's failures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram dropped the book then with a spasmodic clearing of his throat, and
      hurriedly resumed his search. When he did find his wife, at last, he gave
      a cry of dismay&mdash;she was on her own bed, huddled in a little heap,
      and shaking with sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy! Why, Billy!&rdquo; he gasped, striding to the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy sat up at once, and hastily wiped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it you, B-Bertram? I didn't hear you come in. You&mdash;you s-said
      you weren't coming till six o'clock!&rdquo; she choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, what is the meaning of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-nothing. I&mdash;I guess I'm just tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo; Bertram spoke sternly, almost sharply. He was
      wondering why he had not noticed before the little hollows in his wife's
      cheeks. &ldquo;Billy, what have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, n-nothing extra, only some sweeping, and cleaning out the
      refrigerator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweeping! Cleaning! <i>You!</i> I thought Mrs. Durgin did that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does. I mean she did. But she couldn't come. She broke her leg&mdash;fell
      off the stepladder where she was three days ago. So I <i>had</i> to do it.
      And to-day, someway, everything went wrong. I burned me, and I cut me, and
      I used two sodas with not any cream of tartar, and I should think I didn't
      know anything, not anything!&rdquo; And down went Billy's head into the pillows
      again in another burst of sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      With gentle yet uncompromising determination, Bertram gathered his wife
      into his arms and carried her to the big chair. There, for a few minutes,
      he soothed and petted her as if she were a tired child&mdash;which,
      indeed, she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, this thing has got to stop,&rdquo; he said then. There was a very
      inexorable ring of decision in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This housework business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy sat up with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Bertram, it isn't fair. You can't&mdash;you mustn't&mdash;just
      because of to-day! I <i>can</i> do it. I have done it. I've done it days
      and days, and it's gone beautifully&mdash;even if they did say I
      couldn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be an e-efficient housekeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said you couldn't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Hannah and K-Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram said a savage word under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy smoke, Billy! I didn't marry you for a cook or a scrub-lady. If you
      <i>had</i> to do it, that would be another matter, of course; and if we
      did have to do it, we wouldn't have a big house like this for you to do it
      in. But I didn't marry for a cook, and I knew I wasn't getting one when I
      married you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy bridled into instant wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I like that, Bertram Henshaw! Can't I cook? Haven't I proved that I
      can cook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram laughed, and kissed the indignant lips till they quivered into an
      unwilling smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your spunky little heart, of course you have! But that doesn't mean
      that I want you to do it. You see, it so happens that you can do other
      things, too; and I'd rather you did those. Billy, you haven't played to me
      for a week, nor sung to me for a month. You're too tired every night to
      talk, or read together, or go anywhere with me. I married for
      companionship&mdash;not cooking and sweeping!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy shook her head stubbornly. Her mouth settled into determined lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all very well to say. You aren't hungry now, Bertram. But it's
      different when you are, and they said 'twould be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! 'They' are Aunt Hannah and Kate, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and the 'Talk to Young Wives.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The w-what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy choked a little. She had forgotten that Bertram did not know about
      the &ldquo;Talk to Young Wives.&rdquo; She wished that she had not mentioned the book,
      but now that she had, she would make the best of it. She drew herself up
      with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a book; a very nice book. It says lots of things&mdash;that have
      come true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is that book? Let me see it, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With visible reluctance Billy got down from her perch on Bertram's knee,
      went to her desk and brought back the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram regarded it frowningly, so frowningly that Billy hastened to its
      defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it's true&mdash;what it says in there, and what Aunt Hannah and Kate
      said. It <i>is</i> different when they're hungry! You said yourself if I'd
      tend to my husband and my home a little more, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram looked up with unfeigned amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said what?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a voice shaken with emotion, Billy repeated the fateful words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never&mdash;when did I say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night Uncle William and I came home from&mdash;Pete's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Bertram stared dumbly; then a shamed red swept to his
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, <i>did</i> I say that? I ought to be shot if I did. But, Billy,
      you said you'd forgiven me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, dear&mdash;truly I did; but, don't you see?&mdash;it was true. I
      <i>hadn't</i> tended to things. So I've been doing it since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden comprehension illuminated Bertram's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, Billy! And is that why you haven't been anywhere, or done
      anything? Is that why Calderwell said to-day that you hadn't been with
      them anywhere, and that&mdash;Great Scott, Billy! Did you think I was such
      a selfish brute as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but when I was going with them I <i>was</i> following the book&mdash;I
      thought,&rdquo; quavered Billy; and hurriedly she turned the leaves to a
      carefully marked passage. &ldquo;It's there&mdash;about the outside interests.
      See? I <i>was</i> trying to brush up against them, so that I wouldn't
      interfere with your Art. Then, when you accused me of gallivanting off
      with&mdash;&rdquo; But Bertram swept her back into his arms, and not for some
      minutes could Billy make a coherent speech again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Bertram spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Billy,&rdquo; he exploded, a little shakily, &ldquo;if I could get you off
      somewhere on a desert island, where there weren't any Aunt Hannahs or
      Kates, or Talks to Young Wives, I think there'd be a chance to make you
      happy; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but there was truth in it,&rdquo; interrupted Billy, sitting erect again.
      &ldquo;I <i>didn't</i> know how to run a house, and it was perfectly awful while
      we were having all those dreadful maids, one after the other; and no woman
      should be a wife who doesn't know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, all right, dear,&rdquo; interrupted Bertram, in his turn. &ldquo;We'll
      concede that point, if you like. But you <i>do</i> know now. You've got
      the efficient housewife racket down pat even to the last calory your
      husband should be fed; and I'll warrant there isn't a Mary Ellen in
      Christendom who can find a spot of ignorance on you as big as a pinhead!
      So we'll call that settled. What you need now is a good rest; and you're
      going to have it, too. I'm going to have six Mary Ellens here to-morrow
      morning. Six! Do you hear? And all you've got to do is to get your
      gladdest rags together for a trip to Europe with me next month. Because
      we're going. I shall get the tickets to-morrow, <i>after</i> I send the
      six Mary Ellens packing up here. Now come, put on your bonnet. We're going
      down town to dinner.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII. BILLY TRIES HER HAND AT &ldquo;MANAGING&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Bertram did not engage six Mary Ellens the next morning, nor even one, as
      it happened; for that evening, Eliza&mdash;who had not been unaware of
      conditions at the Strata&mdash;telephoned to say that her mother was so
      much better now she believed she could be spared to come to the Strata for
      several hours each day, if Mrs. Henshaw would like to have her begin in
      that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy agreed promptly, and declared herself as more than willing to put up
      with such an arrangement. Bertram, it is true, when he heard of the plan,
      rebelled, and asserted that what Billy needed was a rest, an entire rest
      from care and labor. In fact, what he wanted her to do, he said, was to
      gallivant&mdash;to gallivant all day long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Billy had laughed, coloring to the tips of her ears. &ldquo;Besides,
      as for the work, Bertram, with just you and me here, and with all my vast
      experience now, and Eliza here for several hours every day, it'll be
      nothing but play for this little time before we go away. You'll see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I'll <i>see</i>, then,&rdquo; Bertram had nodded meaningly. &ldquo;But
      just make sure that it <i>is</i> play for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; laughed Billy; and there the matter had ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza began work the next day, and Billy did indeed soon find herself
      &ldquo;playing&rdquo; under Bertram's watchful insistence. She resumed her music, and
      brought out of exile the unfinished song. With Bertram she took drives and
      walks; and every two or three days she went to see Aunt Hannah and Marie.
      She was pleasantly busy, too, with plans for her coming trip; and it was
      not long before even the remorseful Bertram had to admit that Billy was
      looking and appearing quite like her old self.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Annex Billy found Calderwell and Arkwright, one day. They greeted
      her as if she had just returned from a far country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you aren't the stranger lady,&rdquo; began Calderwell, looking frankly
      pleased to see her. &ldquo;We'd thought of advertising in the daily press
      somewhat after this fashion: 'Lost, strayed, or stolen, one Billy;
      comrade, good friend, and kind cheerer-up of lonely hearts. Any
      information thankfully received by her bereft, sorrowing friends.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy joined in the laugh that greeted this sally, but Arkwright noticed
      that she tried to change the subject from her own affairs to a discussion
      of the new song on Alice Greggory's piano. Calderwell, however, was not to
      be silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last I heard of this elusive Billy,&rdquo; he resumed, with teasing
      cheerfulness, &ldquo;she was running down a certain lost calory that had slipped
      away from her husband's breakfast, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy wheeled sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get hold of that?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn't,&rdquo; returned the man, defensively. &ldquo;I never got hold of it at
      all. I never even saw the calory&mdash;though, for that matter, I don't
      think I should know one if I did see it! What we feared was, that, in
      hunting the lost calory, you had lost yourself, and&mdash;&rdquo; But Billy
      would hear no more. With her disdainful nose in the air she walked to the
      piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Mr. Arkwright,&rdquo; she said with dignity. &ldquo;Let's try this song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright rose at once and accompanied her to the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had sung the song through twice when Billy became uneasily aware
      that, on the other side of the room, Calderwell and Alice Greggory were
      softly chuckling over something they had found in a magazine. Billy
      frowned, and twitched the corners of a pile of music, with restless
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Alice hasn't got some quartets here somewhere,&rdquo; she murmured,
      her disapproving eyes still bent on the absorbed couple across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright was silent. Billy, throwing a hurried glance into his face,
      thought she detected a somber shadow in his eyes. She thought, too, she
      knew why it was there. So possessed had Billy been, during the early
      winter, of the idea that her special mission in life was to inaugurate and
      foster a love affair between disappointed Mr. Arkwright and lonely Alice
      Greggory, that now she forgot, for a moment, that Arkwright himself was
      quite unaware of her efforts. She thought only that the present shadow on
      his face must be caused by the same thing that brought worry to her own
      heart&mdash;the manifest devotion of Calderwell to Alice Greggory just now
      across the room. Instinctively, therefore, as to a coworker in a common
      cause, she turned a disturbed face to the man at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, indeed, high time that I looked after something besides lost
      calories,&rdquo; she said significantly. Then, at the evident uncomprehension in
      Arkwright's face, she added: &ldquo;Has it been going on like this&mdash;very
      long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright still, apparently, did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has&mdash;what been going on?&rdquo; he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;over there,&rdquo; answered Billy, impatiently, scarcely knowing
      whether to be more irritated at the threatened miscarriage of her
      cherished plans, or at Arkwright's (to her) wilfully blind insistence on
      her making her meaning more plain. &ldquo;Has it been going on long&mdash;such
      utter devotion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she asked the question Billy turned and looked squarely into
      Arkwright's face. She saw, therefore, the great change that came to it, as
      her meaning became clear to him. Her first feeling was one of shocked
      realization that Arkwright had, indeed, been really blind. Her second&mdash;she
      turned away her eyes hurriedly from what she thought she saw in the man's
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an assumedly gay little cry she sprang to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, what are you two children chuckling over?&rdquo; she demanded,
      crossing the room abruptly. &ldquo;Didn't you hear me say I wanted you to come
      and sing a quartet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy blamed herself very much for what she called her stupidity in so
      baldly summoning Arkwright's attention to Calderwell's devotion to Alice
      Greggory. She declared that she ought to have known better, and she asked
      herself if this were the way she was &ldquo;furthering matters&rdquo; between Alice
      Greggory and Arkwright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy was really seriously disturbed. She had never quite forgiven herself
      for being so blind to Arkwright's feeling for herself during those days
      when he had not known of her engagement to Bertram. She had never
      forgotten, either, the painful scene when he had hopefully told of his
      love, only to be met with her own shocked repudiation. For long weeks
      after that, his face had haunted her. She had wished, oh, so ardently,
      that she could do something in some way to bring him happiness. When,
      therefore, it had come to her knowledge afterward that he was frequently
      with his old friend, Alice Greggory, she had been so glad. It was very
      easy then to fan hope into conviction that here, in this old friend, he
      had found sweet balm for his wounded heart; and she determined at once to
      do all that she could do to help. So very glowing, indeed, was her
      eagerness in the matter, that it looked suspiciously as if she thought,
      could she but bring this thing about, that old scores against herself
      would be erased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy told herself, virtuously, however, that not only for Arkwright did
      she desire this marriage to take place, but for Alice Greggory. In the
      very nature of things Alice would one day be left alone. She was poor, and
      not very strong. She sorely needed the shielding love and care of a good
      husband. What more natural than that her old-time friend and
      almost-sweetheart, M. J. Arkwright, should be that good husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      That really it was more Arkwright and less Alice that was being
      considered, however, was proved when the devotion of Calderwell began to
      be first suspected, then known for a fact. Billy's distress at this turn
      of affairs indicated very plainly that it was not just a husband, but a
      certain one particular husband that she desired for Alice Greggory. All
      the more disturbed was she, therefore, when to-day, seeing her three
      friends together again for the first time for some weeks, she discovered
      increased evidence that her worst fears were to be realized. It was to be
      Alice and Calderwell, not Alice and Arkwright. Arkwright was again to be
      disappointed in his dearest hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Telling herself indignantly that it could not be, it <i>should</i> not be,
      Billy determined to remain after the men had gone, and speak to Alice.
      Just what she would say she did not know. Even what she could say, she was
      not sure. But certainly there must be something, some little thing that
      she could say, which would open Alice's eyes to what she was doing, and
      what she ought to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this frame of mind, therefore, that Billy, after Arkwright and
      Calderwell had gone, spoke to Alice. She began warily, with assumed
      nonchalance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe Mr. Arkwright sings better every time I hear him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. Alice was sorting music at the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think so?&rdquo; Billy raised her voice a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice turned almost with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that? Oh, yes. Well, I don't know; maybe I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would&mdash;if you didn't hear him any oftener than I do,&rdquo; laughed
      Billy. &ldquo;But then, of course you do hear him oftener.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh, no, indeed. Not so very much oftener.&rdquo; Alice had turned back to
      her music. There was a slight embarrassment in her manner. &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;where&mdash;that
      new song&mdash;is,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, who knew very well where the song lay, was not to be diverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! As if Mr. Arkwright wasn't always telling how Alice liked this
      song, and didn't like that one, and thought the other the best yet! I
      don't believe he sings a thing that he doesn't first sing to you. For that
      matter, I fancy he asks your opinion of everything, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Billy, he doesn't!&rdquo; exclaimed Alice, a deep red flaming into her
      cheeks. &ldquo;You know he doesn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed gleefully. She had not been slow to note the color in her
      friend's face, or to ascribe to it the one meaning she wished to ascribe
      to it. So sure, indeed, was she now that her fears had been groundless,
      that she flung caution to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! My dear Alice, you can't expect us all to be blind,&rdquo; she teased.
      &ldquo;Besides, we all think it's such a lovely arrangement that we're just glad
      to see it. He's such a fine fellow, and we like him so much! We couldn't
      ask for a better husband for you than Mr. Arkwright, and&mdash;&rdquo; From
      sheer amazement at the sudden white horror in Alice Greggory's face, Billy
      stopped short. &ldquo;Why, Alice!&rdquo; she faltered then.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a visible effort Alice forced her trembling lips to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband&mdash;<i>Mr. Arkwright!</i> Why, Billy, you couldn't have seen&mdash;you
      haven't seen&mdash;there's nothing you <i>could</i> see! He isn't&mdash;he
      wasn't&mdash;he can't be! We&mdash;we're nothing but friends, Billy, just
      good friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy, though dismayed, was still not quite convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends! Nonsense! When&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Alice interrupted feverishly. Alice, in an agony of fear lest the true
      state of affairs should be suspected, was hiding behind a bulwark of
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Billy, please! Say no more. You're quite wrong, entirely. You'll
      never, never hear of my marrying Mr. Arkwright. As I said before, we're
      friends&mdash;the best of friends; that is all. We couldn't be anything
      else, possibly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy, plainly discomfited, fell back; but she threw a sharp glance into
      her friend's flushed countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;because of&mdash;Hugh Calderwell?&rdquo; she demanded. Then, for
      the second time that afternoon throwing discretion to the winds, she went
      on plaintively: &ldquo;You won't listen, of course. Girls in love never do. Hugh
      is all right, and I like him; but there's more real solid worth in Mr.
      Arkwright's little finger than there is in Hugh's whole self. And&mdash;&rdquo;
       But a merry peal of laughter from Alice Greggory interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, pray, do you think I'm in love with Hugh Calderwell?&rdquo; she demanded.
      There was a curious note of something very like relief in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn't know,&rdquo; began Billy, uncertainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll tell you now,&rdquo; smiled Alice. &ldquo;I'm not. Furthermore, perhaps
      it's just as well that you should know right now that I don't intend to
      marry&mdash;ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Alice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; There was determination, and there was still that curious note of
      relief in the girl's voice. It was as if, somewhere, a great danger had
      been avoided. &ldquo;I have my music. That is enough. I'm not intending to
      marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but Alice, while I will own up I'm glad it isn't Hugh Calderwell,
      there <i>is</i> Mr. Arkwright, and I did hope&mdash;&rdquo; But Alice shook her
      head and turned resolutely away. At that moment, too, Aunt Hannah came in
      from the street, so Billy could say no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah dropped herself a little wearily into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've just come from Marie's,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; asked Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah smiled, and raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just now she's quite exercised over another rattle&mdash;from her
      cousin out West, this time. There were four little silver bells on it, and
      she hasn't got any janitor's wife now to give it to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed softly, but Aunt Hannah had more to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know she isn't going to allow any toys but Teddy bears and woolly
      lambs, of which, I believe, she has already bought quite an assortment.
      She says they don't rattle or squeak. I declare, when I see the woolen
      pads and rubber hushers that that child has put everywhere all over the
      house, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. And she's so worried! It
      seems Cyril must needs take just this time to start composing a new opera
      or symphony, or something; and never before has she allowed him to be
      interrupted by anything on such an occasion. But what he'll do when the
      baby comes she says she doesn't know, for she says she can't&mdash;she
      just can't keep it from bothering him some, she's afraid. As if any opera
      or symphony that ever lived was of more consequence than a man's own
      child!&rdquo; finished Aunt Hannah, with an indignant sniff, as she reached for
      her shawl.

      CHAPTER XIX. A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK FOR CYRIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was early in the forenoon of the first day of July that Eliza told her
      mistress that Mrs. Stetson was asking for her at the telephone. Eliza's
      face was not a little troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid, maybe, it isn't good news,&rdquo; she stammered, as her mistress
      hurriedly arose. &ldquo;She's at Mr. Cyril Henshaw's&mdash;Mrs. Stetson is&mdash;and
      she seemed so terribly upset about something that there was no making real
      sense out of what she said. But she asked for you, and said to have you
      come quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy, her own face paling, was already at the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Aunt Hannah. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my grief and conscience, Billy, if you <i>can</i>, come up here,
      please. You must come! <i>Can't</i> you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, of course. But&mdash;but&mdash;<i>Marie!</i> The&mdash;the <i>baby!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint groan came across the wires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my grief and conscience, Billy! It isn't <i>the</i> baby. It's <i>babies!</i>
      It's twins&mdash;boys. Cyril has them now&mdash;the nurse hasn't got here
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twins! <i>Cyril</i> has them!&rdquo; broke in Billy, hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and they're crying something terrible. We've sent for a second nurse
      to come, too, of course, but she hasn't got here yet, either. And those
      babies&mdash;if you could hear them! That's what we want you for, to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Billy was almost laughing now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I'll come out&mdash;and hear them,&rdquo; she called a bit wildly,
      as she hung up the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some little time later, a palpably nervous maid admitted Billy to the home
      of Mr. and Mrs. Cyril Henshaw. Even as the door was opened, Billy heard
      faintly, but unmistakably, the moaning wails of two infants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Stetson says if you will please to help Mr. Henshaw with the
      babies,&rdquo; stammered the maid, after the preliminary questions and answers.
      &ldquo;I've been in when I could, and they're all right, only they're crying.
      They're in his den. We had to put them as far away as possible&mdash;their
      crying worried Mrs. Henshaw so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; murmured Billy. &ldquo;I'll go to them at once. No, don't trouble
      to come. I know the way. Just tell Mrs. Stetson I'm here, please,&rdquo; she
      finished, as she tossed her hat and gloves on to the hall table, and
      turned to go upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy's feet made no sound on the soft rugs. The crying, however, grew
      louder and louder as she approached the den. Softly she turned the knob
      and pushed open the door. She stopped short, then, at what she saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril had not heard her, nor seen her. His back was partly toward the
      door. His coat was off, and his hair stood fiercely on end as if a nervous
      hand had ruffled it. His usually pale face was very red, and his forehead
      showed great drops of perspiration. He was on his feet, hovering over the
      couch, at each end of which lay a rumpled roll of linen, lace, and
      flannel, from which emerged a prodigiously puckered little face, two
      uncertainly waving rose-leaf fists, and a wail of protesting rage that was
      not uncertain in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one hand Cyril held a Teddy bear, in the other his watch, dangling from
      its fob chain. Both of these he shook feebly, one after the other, above
      the tiny faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, come, pretty baby, good baby, hush, hush,&rdquo; he begged
      agitatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the doorway Billy clapped her hands to her lips and stifled a laugh.
      Billy knew, of course, that what she should do was to go forward at once,
      and help this poor, distracted man; but Billy, just then, was not doing
      what she knew she ought to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a muttered ejaculation (which Billy, to her sorrow, could not catch)
      Cyril laid down the watch and flung the Teddy bear aside. Then, in very
      evident despair, he gingerly picked up one of the rumpled rolls of
      flannel, lace, and linen, and held it straight out before him. After a
      moment's indecision he began awkwardly to jounce it, teeter it, rock it
      back and forth, and to pat it jerkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, come, pretty baby, good baby, hush, hush,&rdquo; he begged again,
      frantically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was the change of position; perhaps it was the novelty of the
      motion, perhaps it was only utter weariness, or lack of breath. Whatever
      the cause, the wailing sobs from the bundle in his arms dwindled suddenly
      to a gentle whisper, then ceased altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a ray of hope illuminating his drawn countenance, Cyril carefully
      laid the baby down and picked up the other. Almost confidently now he
      began the jouncing and teetering and rocking as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there! Oh, come, come, pretty baby, good baby, hush, hush,&rdquo; he
      chanted again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he was not so successful. Perhaps he had lost his skill. Perhaps
      it was merely the world-old difference in babies. At all events, this
      infant did not care for jerks and jounces, and showed it plainly by
      emitting loud and yet louder wails of rage&mdash;wails in which his
      brother on the couch speedily joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, come, pretty baby, good baby, hush, hush&mdash;<i>confound it</i>,
      HUSH, I say!&rdquo; exploded the frightened, weary, baffled, distracted man,
      picking up the other baby, and trying to hold both his sons at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy hurried forward then, tearfully, remorsefully, her face all
      sympathy, her arms all tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Cyril, let me help you,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril turned abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, <i>some</i> one's come,&rdquo; he groaned, holding out both the
      babies, with an exuberance of generosity. &ldquo;Billy, you've saved my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've come, Cyril, and I'll help every bit I can; but I don't know a
      thing&mdash;not a single thing about them myself. Dear me, aren't they
      cunning? But, Cyril, do they always cry so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father-of-an-hour drew himself stiffly erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cry? What do you mean? Why shouldn't they cry?&rdquo; he demanded indignantly.
      &ldquo;I want you to understand that Doctor Brown said those were A number I
      fine boys! Anyhow, I guess there's no doubt they've got lungs all right,&rdquo;
       he added, with a grim smile, as he pulled out his handkerchief and drew it
      across his perspiring brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy did not have an opportunity to show Cyril how much or how little she
      knew about babies, for in another minute the maid had appeared with the
      extra nurse; and that young woman, with trained celerity and easy
      confidence, assumed instant command, and speedily had peace and order
      restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril, freed from responsibility, cast longing eyes, for a moment, upon
      his work; but the next minute, with a despairing glance about him, he
      turned and fled precipitately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, following the direction of his eyes, suppressed a smile. On the top
      of Cyril's manuscript music on the table lay a hot-water bottle. Draped
      over the back of his favorite chair was a pink-bordered baby blanket. On
      the piano-stool rested a beribboned and beruffled baby's toilet basket.
      From behind the sofa pillow leered ridiculously the Teddy bear, just as it
      had left Cyril's desperate hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder, indeed, that Billy smiled. Billy was thinking of what Marie had
      said not a week before:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall keep the baby, of course, in the nursery. I've been in homes
      where they've had baby things strewn from one end of the house to the
      other; but it won't be that way here. In the first place, I don't believe
      in it; but, even if I did, I'd have to be careful on account of Cyril.
      Imagine Cyril's trying to write his music with a baby in the room! No! I
      shall keep the baby in the nursery, if possible; but wherever it is, it
      won't be anywhere near Cyril's den, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy suppressed many a smile during the days that immediately followed
      the coming of the twins. Some of the smiles, however, refused to be
      suppressed. They became, indeed, shamelessly audible chuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy was to sail the tenth, and, naturally, during those early July days,
      her time was pretty much occupied with her preparations for departure; but
      nothing could keep her from frequent, though short, visits to the home of
      her brother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twins were proving themselves to be fine, healthy boys. Two trained
      maids, and two trained nurses ruled the household with a rod of iron. As
      to Cyril&mdash;Billy declared that Cyril was learning something every day
      of his life now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, he's learning things,&rdquo; she said to Aunt Hannah, one morning;
      &ldquo;lots of things. For instance: he has his breakfast now, not when he wants
      it, but when the maid wants to give it to him&mdash;which is precisely at
      eight o'clock every morning. So he's learning punctuality. And for the
      first time in his life he has discovered the astounding fact that there
      are several things more important in the world than is the special piece
      of music he happens to be composing&mdash;chiefly the twins' bath, the
      twins' nap, the twins' airing, and the twins' colic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah laughed, though she frowned, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, surely, Billy, with two nurses and the maids, Cyril doesn't have to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
       She came to a helpless pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; laughed Billy; &ldquo;Cyril doesn't have to really attend to any of
      those things&mdash;though I have seen each of the nurses, at different
      times, unhesitatingly thrust a twin into his arms and bid him hold the
      child till she comes back. But it's this way. You see, Marie must be kept
      quiet, and the nursery is very near her room. It worries her terribly when
      either of the children cries. Besides, the little rascals have apparently
      fixed up some sort of labor-union compact with each other, so that if one
      cries for something or nothing, the other promptly joins in and helps. So
      the nurses have got into the habit of picking up the first disturber of
      the peace, and hurrying him to quarters remote; and Cyril's den being the
      most remote of all, they usually fetch up there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;they take those babies into Cyril's den&mdash;<i>now</i>?&rdquo;
       Even Aunt Hannah was plainly aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; twinkled Billy. &ldquo;I fancy their Hygienic Immaculacies approved of
      Cyril's bare floors, undraped windows, and generally knick-knackless
      condition. Anyhow, they've made his den a sort of&mdash;of annex to the
      nursery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but Cyril! What does he say?&rdquo; stammered the dumfounded Aunt
      Hannah. &ldquo;Think of Cyril's standing a thing like that! Doesn't he do
      anything&mdash;or say anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy smiled, and lifted her brows quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Aunt Hannah, did you ever know <i>many</i> people to have the
      courage to 'say things' to one of those becapped, beaproned, bespotless
      creatures of loftily superb superiority known as trained nurses? Besides,
      you wouldn't recognize Cyril now. Nobody would. He's as meek as Moses, and
      has been ever since his two young sons were laid in his reluctant,
      trembling arms. He breaks into a cold sweat at nothing, and moves about
      his own home as if he were a stranger and an interloper, endured merely on
      sufferance in this abode of strange women and strange babies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; scoffed Aunt Hannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's so,&rdquo; maintained Billy, merrily. &ldquo;Now, for instance. You know
      Cyril always has been in the habit of venting his moods on the piano (just
      as I do, only more so) by playing exactly as he feels. Well, as near as I
      can gather, he was at his usual trick the next day after the twins
      arrived; and you can imagine about what sort of music it would be, after
      what he had been through the preceding forty-eight hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don't know exactly what happened, but Julia&mdash;Marie's
      second maid, you know&mdash;tells the story. She's been with them long
      enough to know something of the way the whole household always turns on
      the pivot of the master's whims; so she fully appreciated the situation.
      She says she heard him begin to play, and that she never heard such queer,
      creepy, shivery music in her life; but that he hadn't been playing five
      minutes before one of the nurses came into the living-room where Julia was
      dusting, and told her to tell whoever was playing to stop that dreadful
      noise, as they wanted to take the twins in there for their nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But I didn't do it, ma'am,' Julia says. 'I wa'n't lookin' for losin' my
      place, an' I let the young woman do the job herself. An' she done it, pert
      as you please. An' jest as I was seekin' a hidin'-place for the explosion,
      if Mr. Henshaw didn't come out lookin' a little wild, but as meek as a
      lamb; an' when he sees me he asked wouldn't I please get him a cup of
      coffee, good an' strong. An' I got it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; finished Billy, &ldquo;Cyril is learning things&mdash;lots of
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my grief and conscience! I should say he was,&rdquo; half-shivered Aunt
      Hannah. &ldquo;<i>Cyril</i> looking meek as a lamb, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it must be a new experience&mdash;for Cyril. For a man whose daily
      existence for years has been rubber-heeled and woolen-padded, and whose
      family from boyhood has stood at attention and saluted if he so much as
      looked at them, it must be quite a change, as things are now. However,
      it'll be different, of course, when Marie is on her feet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she know at all how things are going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very much, as yet, though I believe she has begun to worry some. She
      confided to me one day that she was glad, of course, that she had two
      darling babies, instead of one; but that she was afraid it might be hard,
      just at first, to teach them both at once to be quiet; for she was afraid
      that while she was teaching one, the other would be sure to cry, or do
      something noisy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do something noisy, indeed!&rdquo; ejaculated Aunt Hannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the real state of affairs, Marie doesn't dream that Cyril's sacred
      den is given over to Teddy bears and baby blankets. All is, I hope she'll
      be measurably strong before she does find it out,&rdquo; laughed Billy, as she
      rose to go.

      CHAPTER XX. ARKWRIGHT'S EYES ARE OPENED
    </h2>
    <p>
      William came back from his business trip the eighth of July, and on the
      ninth Billy and Bertram went to New York. Eliza's mother was so well now
      that Eliza had taken up her old quarters in the Strata, and the household
      affairs were once more running like clockwork. Later in the season William
      would go away for a month's fishing trip, and the house would be closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Bertram Henshaw were not expected to return until the first
      of October; but with Eliza to look after the comfort of William, the
      mistress of the house did no worrying. Ever since Pete's going, Eliza had
      said that she preferred to be the only maid, with a charwoman to come in
      for the heavier work; and to this arrangement her mistress had willingly
      consented, for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie and the babies were doing finely, and Aunt Hannah's health, and
      affairs at the Annex, were all that could be desired. As Billy, indeed,
      saw it, there was only one flaw to mar her perfect content on this holiday
      trip with Bertram, and that was her disappointment over the very evident
      disaster that had come to her cherished matrimonial plans for Arkwright
      and Alice Greggory. She could not forget Arkwright's face that day at the
      Annex, when she had so foolishly called his attention to Calderwell's
      devotion; and she could not forget, either, Alice Greggory's very obvious
      perturbation a little later, and her suspiciously emphatic assertion that
      she had no intention of marrying any one, certainly not Arkwright. As
      Billy thought of all this now, she could not but admit that it did look
      dark for Arkwright&mdash;poor Arkwright, whom she, more than any one else
      in the world, perhaps, had a special reason for wishing to see happily
      married.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, then, this one cloud on Billy's horizon as the big boat that
      was to bear her across the water steamed down the harbor that beautiful
      July day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it chanced, naturally, perhaps, not only was Billy thinking of
      Arkwright that morning, but Arkwright was thinking of Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright had thought frequently of Billy during the last few days,
      particularly since that afternoon meeting at the Annex when the four had
      renewed their old good times together. Up to that day Arkwright had been
      trying not to think of Billy. He had been &ldquo;fighting his tiger skin.&rdquo;
       Sternly he had been forcing himself to meet her, to see her, to talk with
      her, to sing with her, or to pass her by&mdash;all with the indifference
      properly expected to be shown in association with Mrs. Bertram Henshaw,
      another man's wife. He had known, of course, that deep down in his heart
      he loved her, always had loved her, and always would love her. Hopelessly
      and drearily he accepted this as a fact even while with all his might
      fighting that tiger skin. So sure was he, indeed, of this, so implicitly
      had he accepted it as an unalterable certainty, that in time even his
      efforts to fight it became almost mechanical and unconscious in their
      stern round of forced indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came that day at the Annex&mdash;and the discovery: the discovery
      which he had made when Billy called his attention to Calderwell and Alice
      Greggory across the room in the corner; the discovery which had come with
      so blinding a force, and which even now he was tempted to question as to
      its reality; the discovery that not Billy Neilson, nor Mrs. Bertram
      Henshaw, nor even the tender ghost of a lost love held the center of his
      heart&mdash;but Alice Greggory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first intimation of all this had come with his curious feeling of
      unreasoning hatred and blind indignation toward Calderwell as, through
      Billy's eyes, he had seen the two together. Then had come the overwhelming
      longing to pick up Alice Greggory and run off with her&mdash;somewhere,
      anywhere, so that Calderwell could not follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once, however, he had pulled himself up short with the mental cry of
      &ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; What was it to him if Calderwell did care for Alice Greggory?
      Surely he himself was not in love with the girl. He was in love with
      Billy; that is&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all confusion then, in his mind, and he was glad indeed when he
      could leave the house. He wanted to be alone. He wanted to think. He must,
      in some way, thrash out this astounding thing that had come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright did not visit the Annex again for some days. Until he was more
      nearly sure of himself and of his feelings, he did not wish to see Alice
      Greggory. It was then that he began to think of Billy, deliberately,
      purposefully, for it must be, of course, that he had made a mistake, he
      told himself. It must be that he did, really, still care for Billy&mdash;though
      of course he ought not to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright made another discovery then. He learned that, however
      deliberately he started in to think of Billy, he ended every time in
      thinking of Alice. He thought of how good she had been to him, and of how
      faithful she had been in helping him to fight his love for Billy. Just
      here he decided, for a moment, that probably, after all, his feeling of
      anger against Calderwell was merely the fear of losing this helpful
      comradeship that he so needed. Even with himself, however, Arkwright could
      not keep up this farce long, and very soon he admitted miserably that it
      was not the comradeship of Alice Greggory that he wanted or needed, but
      the love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew it now. No longer was there any use in beating about the bush. He
      did love Alice Greggory; but so curiously and unbelievably stupid had he
      been that he had not found it out until now. And now it was too late. Had
      not even Billy called his attention to the fact of Calderwell's devotion?
      Besides, had not he himself, at the very first, told Calderwell that he
      might have a clear field?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fool that he had been to let another thus lightly step in and win from
      under his very nose what might have been his if he had but known his own
      mind before it was too late!
    </p>
    <p>
      But was it, after all, quite too late? He and Alice were old friends. Away
      back in their young days in their native town they had been, indeed,
      almost sweethearts, in a boy-and-girl fashion. It would not have taken
      much in those days, he believed, to have made the relationship more
      interesting. But changes had come. Alice had left town, and for years they
      had drifted apart. Then had come Billy, and Billy had found Alice, thus
      bringing about the odd circumstance of their renewing of acquaintanceship.
      Perhaps, at that time, if he had not already thought he cared for Billy,
      there would have been something more than acquaintanceship.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he <i>had</i> thought he cared for Billy all these years; and now, at
      this late day, to wake up and find that he cared for Alice! A pretty mess
      he had made of things! Was he so inconstant then, so fickle? Did he not
      know his own mind five minutes at a time? What would Alice Greggory think,
      even if he found the courage to tell her? What could she think? What could
      anybody think?
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright fairly ground his teeth in impotent wrath&mdash;and he did not
      know whether he were the most angry that he did not love Billy, or that he
      had loved Billy, or that he loved somebody else now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while he was in this unenviable frame of mind that he went to see
      Alice. Not that he had planned definitely to speak to her of his
      discovery, nor yet that he had planned not to. He had, indeed, planned
      nothing. For a man usually so decided as to purpose and energetic as to
      action, he was in a most unhappy state of uncertainty and changeableness.
      One thing only was unmistakably clear to him, and that was that he must
      see Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For months, now, he had taken to Alice all his hopes and griefs,
      perplexities and problems; and never had he failed to find comfort in the
      shape of sympathetic understanding and wise counsel. To Alice, therefore,
      now he turned as a matter of course, telling himself vaguely that,
      perhaps, after he had seen Alice, he would feel better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just how intimately this particular problem of his concerned Alice
      herself, he did not stop to realize. He did not, indeed, think of it at
      all from Alice's standpoint&mdash;until he came face to face with the girl
      in the living-room at the Annex. Then, suddenly, he did. His manner became
      at once, consequently, full of embarrassment and quite devoid of its usual
      frank friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it happened, this was perhaps the most unfortunate thing that could
      have occurred, so far as it concerned the attitude of Alice Greggory, for
      thereby innumerable tiny sparks of suspicion that had been tormenting the
      girl for days were instantly fanned into consuming flames of conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice had not been slow to note Arkwright's prolonged absence from the
      Annex. Coming as it did so soon after her most disconcerting talk with
      Billy in regard to her own relations with him, it had filled her with
      frightened questionings.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Billy had seen things to make her think of linking their names
      together, perhaps Arkwright himself had heard some such idea put forth
      somewhere, and that was why he was staying away&mdash;to show the world
      that there was no foundation for such rumors. Perhaps he was even doing it
      to show <i>her</i> that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in her thoughts Alice could scarcely bring herself to finish the
      sentence. That Arkwright should ever suspect for a moment that she cared
      for him was intolerable. Painfully conscious as she was that she did care
      for him, it was easy to fear that others must be conscious of it, too. Had
      she not already proof that Billy suspected it? Why, then, might not it be
      quite possible, even probable, that Arkwright suspected it, also; and,
      because he did suspect it, had decided that it would be just as well,
      perhaps, if he did not call so often.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of Alice's angry insistence to herself that, after all, this
      could not be the case&mdash;that the man <i>knew</i> she understood he
      still loved Billy&mdash;she could not help fearing, in the face of
      Arkwright's unusual absence, that it might yet be true. When, therefore,
      he finally did appear, only to become at once obviously embarrassed in her
      presence, her fears instantly became convictions. It was true, then. The
      man did believe she cared for him, and he had been trying to teach her&mdash;to
      save her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To teach her! To save her, indeed! Very well, he should see! And
      forthwith, from that moment, Alice Greggory's chief reason for living
      became to prove to Mr. M. J. Arkwright that he needed not to teach her, to
      save her, nor yet to sympathize with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; she greeted him, with a particularly bright smile. &ldquo;I'm
      sure I <i>hope</i> you are well, such a beautiful day as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I'm well, I suppose. Still, I have felt better in my life,&rdquo;
       smiled Arkwright, with some constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm sorry,&rdquo; murmured the girl, striving so hard to speak with
      impersonal unconcern that she did not notice the inaptness of her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Sorry I've felt better, are you?&rdquo; retorted Arkwright, with nervous
      humor. Then, because he was embarrassed, he said the one thing he had
      meant not to say: &ldquo;Don't you think I'm quite a stranger? It's been some
      time since I've been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alice, smarting under the sting of what she judged to be the only possible
      cause for his embarrassment, leaped to this new opportunity to show her
      lack of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, has it?&rdquo; she murmured carelessly. &ldquo;Well, I don't know but it has, now
      that I come to think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright frowned gloomily. A week ago he would have tossed back a
      laughingly aggrieved remark as to her unflattering indifference to his
      presence. Now he was in no mood for such joking. It was too serious a
      matter with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been busy, no doubt, with&mdash;other matters,&rdquo; he presumed
      forlornly, thinking of Calderwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have been busy,&rdquo; assented the girl. &ldquo;One is always happier, I
      think, to be busy. Not that I meant that I needed the work to <i>be</i>
      happy,&rdquo; she added hastily, in a panic lest he think she had a consuming
      sorrow to kill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; he murmured abstractedly, rising to his feet and
      crossing the room to the piano. Then, with an elaborate air of trying to
      appear very natural, he asked jovially: &ldquo;Anything new to play to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alice arose at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have a little nocturne that I was playing to Mr. Calderwell last
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to Calderwell!&rdquo; Arkwright had stiffened perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. <i>He</i> didn't like it. I'll play it to you and see what you say,&rdquo;
       she smiled, seating herself at the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he had liked it, it's safe to say I shouldn't,&rdquo; shrugged
      Arkwright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; laughed the girl, beginning to appear more like her natural
      self. &ldquo;I should think you were Mr. Cyril Henshaw! Mr. Calderwell <i>is</i>
      partial to ragtime, I'll admit. But there are some good things he likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are, indeed, <i>some</i> good things he likes,&rdquo; returned Arkwright,
      with grim emphasis, his somber eyes fixed on what he believed to be the
      one especial object of Calderwell's affections at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice, unaware both of the melancholy gaze bent upon herself and of the
      cause thereof, laughed again merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mr. Calderwell,&rdquo; she cried, as she let her fingers slide into soft,
      introductory chords. &ldquo;He isn't to blame for not liking what he calls our
      lost spirits that wail. It's just the way he's made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright vouchsafed no reply. With an abrupt gesture he turned and began
      to pace the room moodily. At the piano Alice slipped from the chords into
      the nocturne. She played it straight through, then, with a charm and skill
      that brought Arkwright's feet to a pause before it was half finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, that's great!&rdquo; he breathed, when the last tone had quivered
      into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, isn't it&mdash;beautiful?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was very quiet, and in semi-darkness. The last rays of a late
      June sunset had been filling the room with golden light, but it was gone
      now. Even at the piano by the window, Alice had barely been able to see
      clearly enough to read the notes of her nocturne.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Arkwright the air still trembled with the exquisite melody that had but
      just left her fingers. A quick fire came to his eyes. He forgot everything
      but that it was Alice there in the half-light by the window&mdash;Alice,
      whom he loved. With a low cry he took a swift step toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the girl was on her feet. But it was not toward him that she
      turned. It was away&mdash;resolutely, and with a haste that was strangely
      like terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice, too, had forgotten, for just a moment. She had let herself drift
      into a dream world where there was nothing but the music she was playing
      and the man she loved. Then the music had stopped, and the man had spoken
      her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice remembered then. She remembered Billy, whom this man loved. She
      remembered the long days just passed when this man had stayed away,
      presumably to teach <i>her</i>&mdash;to save <i>her</i>. And now, at the
      sound of his voice speaking her name, she had almost bared her heart to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder that Alice, with a haste that looked like terror, crossed the
      floor and flooded the room with light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; she shivered, carefully avoiding Arkwright's eyes. &ldquo;If Mr.
      Calderwell were here now he'd have some excuse to talk about our lost
      spirits that wail. That <i>is</i> a creepy piece of music when you play it
      in the dark!&rdquo; And, for fear that he should suspect how her heart was
      aching, she gave a particularly brilliant and joyous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again at the mention of Calderwell's name Arkwright stiffened
      perceptibly. The fire left his eyes. For a moment he did not speak; then,
      gravely, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calderwell? Yes, perhaps he would; and&mdash;you ought to be a judge, I
      should think. You see him quite frequently, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, of course. He often comes out here, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I had heard that he did&mdash;since <i>you</i> came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His meaning was unmistakable. Alice looked up quickly. A prompt denial of
      his implication was on her lips when the thought came to her that perhaps
      just here lay a sure way to prove to this man before her that there was,
      indeed, no need for him to teach her, to save her, or yet to sympathize
      with her. She could not affirm, of course; but she need not deny&mdash;yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she laughed lightly, pleased that she could feel what she
      hoped would pass for a telltale color burning her cheeks. &ldquo;Come, let us
      try some duets,&rdquo; she proposed, leading the way to the piano. And
      Arkwright, interpreting the apparently embarrassed change of subject
      exactly as she had hoped that he would interpret it, followed her, sick at
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'O wert thou in the cauld blast,'&rdquo; sang Arkwright's lips a few moments
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell her now&mdash;when I <i>know</i> she cares for Calderwell,&rdquo;
       gloomily ran his thoughts, the while. &ldquo;It would do no possible good, and
      would only make her unhappy to grieve me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'O wert thou in the cauld blast,'&rdquo; chimed in Alice's alto, low and sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon now he won't be staying away from here any more just to <i>save</i>
      me!&rdquo; ran Alice's thoughts, palpitatingly triumphant.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. BILLY TAKES HER TURN AT QUESTIONING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arkwright did not call to see Alice Greggory for some days. He did not
      want to see Alice now. He told himself wearily that she could not help him
      fight this tiger skin that lay across his path, The very fact of her
      presence by his side would, indeed, incapacitate himself for fighting. So
      he deliberately stayed away from the Annex until the day before he sailed
      for Germany. Then he went out to say good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chagrined as he was at what he termed his imbecile stupidity in not
      knowing his own heart all these past months, and convinced, as he also
      was, that Alice and Calderwell cared for each other, he could see no way
      for him but to play the part of a man of kindliness and honor, leaving a
      clear field for his preferred rival, and bringing no shadow of regret to
      mar the happiness of the girl he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for being his old easy, frank self on this last call, however, that was
      impossible; so Alice found plenty of fuel for her still burning fires of
      suspicion&mdash;fires which had, indeed, blazed up anew at this second
      long period of absence on the part of Arkwright. Naturally, therefore, the
      call was anything but a joy and comfort to either one. Arkwright was
      nervous, gloomy, and abnormally gay by turns. Alice was nervous and
      abnormally gay all the time. Then they said good-by and Arkwright went
      away. He sailed the next day, and Alice settled down to the summer of
      study and hard work she had laid out for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the tenth of September Billy came home. She was brown, plump-cheeked,
      and smiling. She declared that she had had a perfectly beautiful time, and
      that there couldn't be anything in the world nicer than the trip she and
      Bertram had taken&mdash;just they two together. In answer to Aunt Hannah's
      solicitous inquiries, she asserted that she was all well and rested now.
      But there was a vaguely troubled questioning in her eyes that Aunt Hannah
      did not quite like. Aunt Hannah, however, said nothing even to Billy
      herself about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the first friends Billy saw after her return was Hugh Calderwell.
      As it happened Bertram was out when he came, so Billy had the first
      half-hour of the call to herself. She was not sorry for this, as it gave
      her a chance to question Calderwell a little concerning Alice Greggory&mdash;something
      she had long ago determined to do at the first opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me everything&mdash;everything about everybody,&rdquo; she began
      diplomatically, settling herself comfortably for a good visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I'm well, and have had a passably agreeable summer, barring
      the heat, sundry persistent mosquitoes, several grievous disappointments,
      and a felon on my thumb,&rdquo; he began, with shameless imperturbability. &ldquo;I
      have been to Revere once, to the circus once, to Nantasket three times,
      and to Keith's and the 'movies' ten times, perhaps&mdash;to be accurate. I
      have also&mdash;But perhaps there was some one else you desired to inquire
      for,&rdquo; he broke off, turning upon his hostess a bland but unsmiling
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, how could there be?&rdquo; twinkled Billy. &ldquo;Really, Hugh, I always knew
      you had a pretty good opinion of yourself, but I didn't credit you with
      thinking you were <i>everybody</i>. Go on. I'm so interested!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh chuckled softly; but there was a plaintive tone in his voice as he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, no. I've rather lost my interest now. Lack of appreciation always
      did discourage me. We'll talk of something else, please. You enjoyed your
      trip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much. It just couldn't have been nicer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were lucky. The heat here has been something fierce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reasons too numerous, and one too heart-breaking, to mention. Besides,
      you forget,&rdquo; with dignity. &ldquo;There is my profession. I have joined the
      workers of the world now, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fudge, Hugh!&rdquo; laughed Billy. &ldquo;You know very well you're as likely as
      not to start for the ends of the earth to-morrow morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh drew himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't seem to succeed in making people understand that I'm serious,&rdquo; he
      began aggrievedly. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; With an expressive flourish of his hands he
      relaxed suddenly, and fell back in his chair. A slow smile came to his
      lips. &ldquo;Well, Billy, I'll give up. You've hit it,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;I <i>have</i>
      thought seriously of starting to-morrow morning for <i>half-way</i> to the
      ends of the earth&mdash;Panama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have. Even this call was to be a good-by&mdash;if I went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh! But I really thought&mdash;in spite of my teasing&mdash;that
      you had settled down, this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so did I,&rdquo; sighed the man, a little soberly. &ldquo;But I guess it's no
      use, Billy. Oh, I'm coming back, of course, and link arms again with their
      worthy Highnesses, John Doe and Richard Roe; but just now I've got a
      restless fit on me. I want to see the wheels go 'round. Of course, if I
      had my bread and butter and cigars to earn, 'twould be different. But I
      haven't, and I know I haven't; and I suspect that's where the trouble
      lies. If it wasn't for those natal silver spoons of mine that Bertram is
      always talking about, things might be different. But the spoons are there,
      and always have been; and I know they're all ready to dish out mountains
      to climb and lakes to paddle in, any time I've a mind to say the word. So&mdash;I
      just say the word. That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you've said it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so; for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;those reasons that <i>have</i> kept you here all summer,&rdquo;
       ventured Billy, &ldquo;they aren't in&mdash;er&mdash;commission any longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy hesitated, regarding her companion meditatively. Then, with the
      feeling that she had followed a blind alley to its termination, she
      retreated and made a fresh start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you haven't yet told me everything about everybody, you know,&rdquo; she
      hinted smilingly. &ldquo;You might begin that&mdash;I mean the less important
      everybodies, of course, now that I've heard about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Aunt Hannah, and the Greggorys, and Cyril and Marie, and the twins,
      and Mr. Arkwright, and all the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you've had letters, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've had letters from some of them, and I've seen most of them since
      I came back. It's just that I wanted to know <i>your</i> viewpoint of
      what's happened through the summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Aunt Hannah is as dear as ever, wears just as many shawls, and
      still keeps her clock striking twelve when it's half-past eleven. Mrs.
      Greggory is just as sweet as ever&mdash;and a little more frail, I fear,&mdash;bless
      her heart! Mr. Arkwright is still abroad, as I presume you know. I hear he
      is doing great stunts over there, and will sing in Berlin and Paris this
      winter. I'm thinking of going across from Panama later. If I do I shall
      look him up. Mr. and Mrs. Cyril are as well as could be expected when you
      realize that they haven't yet settled on a pair of names for the twins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it&mdash;and the poor little things three months old, too! I think
      it's a shame. You've heard the reason, I suppose. Cyril declares that
      naming babies is one of the most serious and delicate operations in the
      world, and that, for his part, he thinks people ought to select their own
      names when they've arrived at years of discretion. He wants to wait till
      the twins are eighteen, and then make each of them a birthday present of
      the name of their own choosing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if that isn't the limit!&rdquo; laughed Calderwell. &ldquo;I'd heard some such
      thing before, but I hadn't supposed it was really so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is. He says he knows more tomboys and enormous fat women named
      'Grace' and 'Lily,' and sweet little mouse-like ladies staggering along
      under a sonorous 'Jerusha Theodosia' or 'Zenobia Jane'; and that if he
      should name the boys 'Franz' and 'Felix' after Schubert and Mendelssohn as
      Marie wants to, they'd as likely as not turn out to be men who hated the
      sound of music and doted on stocks and dry goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Calderwell. &ldquo;I saw Cyril last week, and he said he hadn't
      named the twins yet, but he didn't tell me why. I offered him two
      perfectly good names myself, but he didn't seem interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eldad and Bildad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh!&rdquo; protested Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; bridled the man. &ldquo;I'm sure those are new and unique, and
      really musical, too&mdash;'way ahead of your Franz and Felix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But those aren't really names!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off our family tree, though they're Bible names, Belle says. Perhaps you
      didn't know, but Sister Belle has been making the dirt fly quite lively of
      late around that family tree of ours, and she wrote me some of her
      discoveries. It seems two of the roots, or branches&mdash;say, are
      ancestors roots, or branches?&mdash;were called Eldad and Bildad. Now I
      thought those names were good enough to pass along, but, as I said before,
      Cyril wasn't interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; laughed Billy. &ldquo;But, honestly, Hugh, it's really
      serious. Marie wants them named <i>something</i>, but she doesn't say much
      to Cyril. Marie wouldn't really breathe, you know, if she thought Cyril
      disapproved of breathing. And in this case Cyril does not hesitate to
      declare that the boys shall name themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a situation!&rdquo; laughed Calderwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it? But, do you know, I can sympathize with it, in a way, for I've
      always mourned so over <i>my</i> name. 'Billy' was always such a trial to
      me! Poor Uncle William wasn't the only one that prepared guns and fishing
      rods to entertain the expected boy. I don't know, though, I'm afraid if
      I'd been allowed to select my name I should have been a 'Helen Clarabella'
      all my days, for that was the name I gave all my dolls, with 'first,'
      'second,' 'third,' and so on, added to them for distinction. Evidently I
      thought that 'Helen Clarabella' was the most feminine appellation
      possible, and the most foreign to the despised 'Billy.' So you see I can
      sympathize with Cyril to a certain extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they must call the little chaps <i>something</i>, now,&rdquo; argued Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy gave a sudden merry laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do,&rdquo; she gurgled, &ldquo;and that's the funniest part of it. Oh, Cyril
      doesn't. He always calls them impersonally 'they' or 'it.' He doesn't see
      much of them anyway, now, I understand. Marie was horrified when she
      realized how the nurses had been using his den as a nursery annex and she
      changed all that instanter, when she took charge of things again. The
      twins stay in the nursery now, I'm told. But about the names&mdash;the
      nurses, it seems, have got into the way of calling them 'Dot' and
      'Dimple.' One has a dimple in his cheek, and the other is a little smaller
      of the two. Marie is no end distressed, particularly as she finds that she
      herself calls them that; and she says the idea of boys being 'Dot' and
      'Dimple'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; laughed Calderwell. &ldquo;Not I regard that as worse than my
      'Eldad' and 'Bildad.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, and Alice says&mdash;By the way, you haven't mentioned Alice,
      but I suppose you see her occasionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy paused in evident expectation of a reply. Billy was, in fact, quite
      pluming herself on the adroit casualness with which she had introduced the
      subject nearest her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you hadn't mentioned her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the briefest of pauses; then with a half-quizzical dejection,
      there came the remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to forget. I told you that I stayed here this summer for reasons
      too numerous, and one too heart-breaking, to mention. She was the <i>one</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The usual thing. She turned me down. Oh, I haven't asked her yet as
      many times as I did you, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hugh!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh tossed her a grim smile and went on imperturbably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm older now, of course, and know more, perhaps. Besides, the finality
      of her remarks was not to be mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy, in spite of her sympathy for Calderwell, was conscious of a throb
      of relief that at least one stumbling-block was removed from Arkwright's
      possible pathway to Alice's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she give any special reason?&rdquo; hazarded Billy, a shade too anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. She said she wasn't going to marry anybody&mdash;only her
      music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; ejaculated Billy, falling back in her chair a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I said that, too,&rdquo; gloomed the man; &ldquo;but it didn't do any good. You
      see, I had known another girl who'd said the same thing once.&rdquo; (He did not
      look up, but a vivid red flamed suddenly into Billy's cheeks.) &ldquo;And she&mdash;when
      the right one came&mdash;forgot all about the music, and married the man.
      So I naturally suspected that Alice would do the same thing. In fact, I
      said so to her. I was bold enough to even call the man by name&mdash;I
      hadn't been jealous of Arkwright for nothing, you see&mdash;but she denied
      it, and flew into such an indignant allegation that there wasn't a word of
      truth in it, that I had to sue for pardon before I got anything like
      peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h!&rdquo; said Billy, in a disappointed voice, falling quite back in her
      chair this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so that's why I'm wanting especially just now to see the wheels go
      'round,&rdquo; smiled Calderwell, a little wistfully. &ldquo;Oh, I shall get over it,
      I suppose. It isn't the first time, I'll own&mdash;but some day I take it
      there will be a last time. Enough of this, however! You haven't told me a
      thing about yourself. How about it? When I come back, are you going to
      give me a dinner cooked by your own fair hands? Going to still play
      Bridget?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; far from it. Eliza has come back, and her cousin from Vermont is
      coming as second girl to help her. But I <i>could</i> cook a dinner for
      you if I had to now, sir, and it wouldn't be potato-mush and cold lamb,&rdquo;
       she bragged shamelessly, as there sounded Bertram's peculiar ring, and the
      click of his key in the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the next afternoon that Billy called on Marie. From Marie's, Billy
      went to the Annex, which was very near Cyril's new house; and there, in
      Aunt Hannah's room, she had what she told Bertram afterwards was a
      perfectly lovely visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah, too, enjoyed the visit very much, though yet there was one
      thing that disturbed her&mdash;the vaguely troubled look in Billy's eyes,
      which to-day was more apparent than ever. Not until just before Billy went
      home did something occur to give Aunt Hannah a possible clue as to what
      was the meaning of it. That something was a question from Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Hannah, why don't I feel like Marie did? why don't I feel like
      everybody does in books and stories? Marie went around with such a
      detached, heavenly, absorbed look in her eyes, before the twins came to
      her home. But I don't. I don't find anything like that in my face, when I
      look in the glass. And I don't feel detached and absorbed and heavenly.
      I'm happy, of course; but I can't help thinking of the dear, dear times
      Bertram and I have together, just we two, and I can't seem to imagine it
      at all with a third person around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy! <i>Third person</i>, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! I knew 'twould shock you,&rdquo; mourned Billy. &ldquo;It shocks me. I <i>want</i>
      to feel detached and heavenly and absorbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Billy, dear, think of it&mdash;calling your own baby a third person!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy sighed despairingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. And I suppose I might as well own up to the rest of it too.
      I&mdash;I'm actually afraid of babies, Aunt Hannah! Well, I am,&rdquo; she
      reiterated, in answer to Aunt Hannah's gasp of disapproval. &ldquo;I'm not used
      to them at all. I never had any little brothers and sisters, and I don't
      know how to treat babies. I&mdash;I'm always afraid they'll break, or
      something. I'm just as afraid of the twins as I can be. How Marie can
      handle them, and toss them about as she does, I don't see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toss them about, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it looks that way to me,&rdquo; sighed Billy. &ldquo;Anyhow, I know I can never
      get to handle them like that&mdash;and that's no way to feel! And I'm
      ashamed of myself because I <i>can't</i> be detached and heavenly and
      absorbed,&rdquo; she added, rising to go. &ldquo;Everybody always is, it seems, but
      just me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlededee, my dear!&rdquo; scoffed Aunt Hannah, patting Billy's downcast
      face. &ldquo;Wait till a year from now, and we'll see about that third-person
      bugaboo you're worrying about. <i>I'm</i> not worrying now; so you'd
      better not!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. A DOT AND A DIMPLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the day Cyril Henshaw's twins were six months old, a momentous
      occurrence marked the date with a flaming red letter of remembrance; and
      it all began with a baby's smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril, in quest of his wife at about ten o'clock that morning, and not
      finding her, pursued his search even to the nursery&mdash;a room he very
      seldom entered. Cyril did not like to go into the nursery. He felt ill at
      ease, and as if he were away from home&mdash;and Cyril was known to abhor
      being away from home since he was married. Now that Marie had taken over
      the reins of government again, he had been obliged to see very little of
      those strange women and babies. Not but that he liked the babies, of
      course. They were his sons, and he was proud of them. They should have
      every advantage that college, special training, and travel could give
      them. He quite anticipated what they would be to him&mdash;when they
      really knew anything. But, of course, <i>now</i>, when they could do
      nothing but cry and wave their absurd little fists, and wobble their heads
      in so fearsome a manner, as if they simply did not know the meaning of the
      word backbone&mdash;and, for that matter, of course they didn't&mdash;why,
      he could not be expected to be anything but relieved when he had his den
      to himself again, with a reasonable chance of finding his manuscript as he
      had left it, and not cut up into a ridiculous string of paper dolls
      holding hands, as he had once found it, after a visit from a woman with a
      small girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Marie had been at the helm, however, he had not been troubled in
      such a way. He had, indeed, known almost his old customary peace and
      freedom from interruption, with only an occasional flitting across his
      path of the strange women and babies&mdash;though he had realized, of
      course, that they were in the house, especially in the nursery. For that
      reason, therefore, he always avoided the nursery when possible. But to-day
      he wanted his wife, and his wife was not to be found anywhere else in the
      house. So, reluctantly, he turned his steps toward the nursery, and, with
      a frown, knocked and pushed open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mrs. Henshaw here?&rdquo; he demanded, not over gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute silence greeted his question. The man saw then that there was no
      one in the room save a baby sitting on a mat in the middle of the floor,
      barricaded on all sides with pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a deeper frown the man turned to go, when a gleeful &ldquo;Ah&mdash;goo!&rdquo;
       halted his steps midway. He wheeled sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;eh?&rdquo; he queried, uncertainly eyeing his small son on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;goo!&rdquo; observed the infant (who had been very lonesome), with
      greater emphasis; and this time he sent into his father's eyes the most
      bewitching of smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by George!&rdquo; murmured the man, weakly, a dawning amazement driving
      the frown from his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spgggh&mdash;oo&mdash;wah!&rdquo; gurgled the boy, holding out two tiny fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slow smile came to the man's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll&mdash;be&mdash;darned,&rdquo; he muttered half-shamefacedly, wholly
      delightedly. &ldquo;If the rascal doesn't act as if he&mdash;knew me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;goo&mdash;spggghh!&rdquo; grinned the infant, toothlessly, but
      entrancingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With almost a stealthy touch Cyril closed the door back of him, and
      advanced a little dubiously toward his son. His countenance carried a
      mixture of guilt, curiosity, and dogged determination so ludicrous that it
      was a pity none but baby eyes could see it. As if to meet more nearly on a
      level this baffling new acquaintance, Cyril got to his knees&mdash;somewhat
      stiffly, it must be confessed&mdash;and faced his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goo&mdash;eee&mdash;ooo&mdash;yah!&rdquo; crowed the baby now, thrashing legs
      and arms about in a transport of joy at the acquisition of this new
      playmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, young man, you&mdash;you don't say so!&rdquo; stammered the
      growingly-proud father, thrusting a plainly timid and unaccustomed finger
      toward his offspring. &ldquo;So you do know me, eh? Well, who am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Da&mdash;da!&rdquo; gurgled the boy, triumphantly clutching the outstretched
      finger, and holding on with a tenacity that brought a gleeful chuckle to
      the lips of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jove! but aren't you the strong little beggar, though! Needn't tell me
      you don't know a good thing when you see it! So I'm 'da-da,' am I?&rdquo; he
      went on, unhesitatingly accepting as the pure gold of knowledge the
      shameless imitation vocabulary his son was foisting upon him. &ldquo;Well, I
      expect I am, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cyril!&rdquo; The door had opened, and Marie was in the room. If she gave a
      start of surprise at her husband's unaccustomed attitude, she quickly
      controlled herself. &ldquo;Julia said you wanted me. I must have been going down
      the back stairs when you came up the front, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Mrs. Henshaw, is it Dot you have in here, or Dimple?&rdquo; asked a new
      voice, as the second nurse entered by another door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Mrs. Henshaw could answer, Cyril, who had got to his feet, turned
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;<i>who</i>?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Oh, Mr. Henshaw,&rdquo; stammered the girl. &ldquo;I beg your pardon. I didn't
      know you were here. It was only that I wanted to know which baby it was.
      We thought we had Dot with us, until&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dot! Dimple!&rdquo; exploded the man. &ldquo;Do you mean to say you have given my <i>sons</i>
      the ridiculous names of '<i>Dot</i>' and '<i>Dimple</i>'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no&mdash;yes&mdash;well, that is&mdash;we had to call them
      something,&rdquo; faltered the nurse, as with a despairing glance at her
      mistress, she plunged through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril turned to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie, what is the meaning of this?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cyril, dear, don't&mdash;don't get so wrought up,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;It's
      only as Mary said, we <i>had</i> to call them something, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrought up, indeed!&rdquo; interrupted Cyril, savagely. &ldquo;Who wouldn't be? 'Dot'
      and 'Dimple'! Great Scott! One would think those boys were a couple of
      kittens or puppies; that they didn't know anything&mdash;didn't have any
      brains! But they have&mdash;if the other is anything like this one, at
      least,&rdquo; he declared, pointing to his son on the floor, who, at this
      opportune moment joined in the conversation to the extent of an
      appropriate &ldquo;Ah&mdash;goo&mdash;da&mdash;da!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, hear that, will you?&rdquo; triumphed the father. &ldquo;What did I tell you?
      That's the way he's been going on ever since I came into the room; The
      little rascal knows me&mdash;so soon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie clapped her fingers to her lips and turned her back suddenly, with a
      spasmodic little cough; but her husband, if he noticed the interruption,
      paid no heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dot and Dimple, indeed!&rdquo; he went on wrathfully. &ldquo;That settles it. We'll
      name those boys to-day, Marie, <i>to-day!</i> Not once again will I let
      the sun go down on a Dot and a Dimple under my roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie turned with a quick little cry of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cyril, I'm so glad! I've so wanted to have them named, you know! And
      shall we call them Franz and Felix, as we'd talked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Franz, Felix, John, James, Paul, Charles&mdash;anything, so it's sane and
      sensible! I'd even adopt Calderwell's absurd Bildad and&mdash;er&mdash;Tomdad,
      or whatever it was, rather than have those poor little chaps insulted a
      day longer with a 'Dot' and a 'Dimple.' Great Scott!&rdquo; And, entirely
      forgetting what he had come to the nursery for, Cyril strode from the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;goo&mdash;spggggh!&rdquo; commented baby from the middle of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on a very windy March day that Bertram Henshaw's son, Bertram, Jr.,
      arrived at the Strata. Billy went so far into the Valley of the Shadow of
      Death for her baby that it was some days before she realized in all its
      importance the presence of the new member of her family. Even when the
      days had become weeks, and Bertram, Jr., was a month and a half old, the
      extreme lassitude and weariness of his young mother was a source of
      ever-growing anxiety to her family and friends. Billy was so unlike
      herself, they all said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If something could only rouse her,&rdquo; suggested the Henshaw's old family
      physician one day. &ldquo;A certain sort of mental shock&mdash;if not too severe&mdash;would
      do the deed, I think, and with no injury&mdash;only benefit. Her physical
      condition is in just the state that needs a stimulus to stir it into new
      life and vigor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it happened, this was said on a certain Monday. Two days later
      Bertram's sister Kate, on her way with her husband to Mr. Hartwell's old
      home in Vermont, stopped over in Boston for a two days' visit. She made
      her headquarters at Cyril's home, but very naturally she went, without
      much delay, to pay her respects to Bertram, Jr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hartwell's brother isn't well,&rdquo; she explained to Billy, after the
      greetings were over. &ldquo;You know he's the only one left there, since Mother
      and Father Hartwell came West. We shall go right on up to Vermont in a
      couple of days, but we just had to stay over long enough to see the baby;
      and we hadn't ever seen the twins, either, you know. By the way, how
      perfectly ridiculous Cyril is over those boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he?&rdquo; smiled Billy, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. One would think there were never any babies born before, to hear him
      talk. He thinks they're the most wonderful things in the world&mdash;and
      they are cunning little fellows, I'll admit. But Cyril thinks they <i>know</i>
      so much,&rdquo; went on Kate, laughingly. &ldquo;He's always bragging of something one
      or the other of them has done. Think of it&mdash;<i>Cyril!</i> Marie says
      it all started from the time last January when he discovered the nurses
      had been calling them Dot and Dimple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; smiled Billy again, faintly, lifting a thin, white, very
      un-Billy-like hand to her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate frowned, and regarded her sister-in-law thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! how you look, Billy!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with cheerful tactlessness.
      &ldquo;They said you did, but, I declare, you look worse than I thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy's pale face reddened perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! It's just that I'm so&mdash;so tired,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;I shall
      be all right soon. How did you leave the children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and happy&mdash;'specially little Kate, because mother was going
      away. Kate is mistress, you know, when I'm gone, and she takes herself
      very seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress! A little thing like her! Why, she can't be more than ten or
      eleven,&rdquo; murmured Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She isn't. She was ten last month. But you'd think she was forty, the
      airs she gives herself, sometimes. Oh, of course there's Nora, and the
      cook, and Miss Winton, the governess, there to really manage things, and
      Mother Hartwell is just around the corner; but little Kate <i>thinks</i>
      she's managing, so she's happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy suppressed a smile. Billy was thinking that little Kate came
      naturally by at least one of her traits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, that child is impossible, sometimes,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Hartwell, with
      a sigh. &ldquo;You know the absurd things she was always saying two or three
      years ago, when we came on to Cyril's wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thought she would get over it. But she doesn't. She's worse, if
      anything; and sometimes her insight, or intuition, or whatever you may
      call it, is positively uncanny. I never know what she's going to remark
      next, when I take her anywhere; but it's safe to say, whatever it is,
      it'll be unexpected and <i>usually</i> embarrassing to somebody. And&mdash;is
      that the baby?&rdquo; broke off Mrs. Hartwell, as a cooing laugh and a woman's
      voice came from the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The nurse has just brought him in, I think,&rdquo; said Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll go right now and see him,&rdquo; rejoined Kate, rising to her feet
      and hurrying into the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Billy lay back wearily in her reclining-chair. She wondered
      why Kate always tired her so. She wished she had had on her blue kimono,
      then perhaps Kate would not have thought she looked so badly. Blue was
      always more becoming to her than&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy turned her head suddenly. From the next room had come Kate's
      clear-cut, decisive voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I don't think he looks a bit like his father. That little snubby
      nose was never the Henshaw nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy drew in her breath sharply, and pulled herself half erect in her
      chair. From the next room came Kate's voice again, after a low murmur from
      the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but he isn't, I tell you. He isn't one bit of a Henshaw baby! The
      Henshaw babies are always <i>pretty</i> ones. They have more hair, and
      they look&mdash;well, different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy gave a low cry, and struggled to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; spoke up Kate, in answer to another indistinct something from
      the nurse. &ldquo;I don't think he's near as pretty as the twins. Of course the
      twins are a good deal older, but they have such a <i>bright</i> look,&mdash;and
      they did have, from the very first. I saw it in their tiniest baby
      pictures. But this baby&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>This</i> baby is <i>mine</i>, please,&rdquo; cut in a tremulous, but
      resolute voice; and Mrs. Hartwell turned to confront Bertram, Jr.'s
      mother, manifestly weak and trembling, but no less manifestly blazing-eyed
      and determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Billy!&rdquo; expostulated Mrs. Hartwell, as Billy stumbled forward and
      snatched the child into her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he doesn't look like the Henshaw babies. Perhaps he isn't as
      pretty as the twins. Perhaps he hasn't much hair, and does have a snub
      nose. He's my baby just the same, and I shall not stay calmly by and see
      him abused! Besides, <i>I</i> think he's prettier than the twins ever
      thought of being; and he's got all the hair I want him to have, and his
      nose is just exactly what a baby's nose ought to be!&rdquo; And, with a superb
      gesture, Billy turned and bore the baby away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. BILLY AND THE ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the doctor heard from the nurse of Mrs. Hartwell's visit and what had
      come of it, he only gave a discreet smile, as befitted himself and the
      occasion; but to his wife privately, that night, the doctor said, when he
      had finished telling the story:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I couldn't have prescribed a better pill if I'd tried!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pill</i>&mdash;Mrs. Hartwell! Oh, Harold,&rdquo; reproved the doctor's wife,
      mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the doctor only chuckled the more, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Billy's friends were worried before because of her lassitude and lack
      of ambition, they were almost as worried now over her amazing alertness
      and insistent activity. Day by day, almost hour by hour, she seemed to
      gain in strength; and every bit she acquired she promptly tested almost to
      the breaking point, so plainly eager was she to be well and strong. And
      always, from morning until night, and again from night until morning, the
      pivot of her existence, around which swung all thoughts, words, actions,
      and plans, was the sturdy little plump-cheeked, firm-fleshed atom of
      humanity known as Bertram, Jr. Even Aunt Hannah remonstrated with her at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Billy, dear,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;one would almost get the idea that you
      thought there wasn't a thing in the world but that baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you know, sometimes I 'most think there isn't,&rdquo; she retorted
      unblushingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy!&rdquo; protested Aunt Hannah; then, a little severely, she demanded:
      &ldquo;And who was it that just last September was calling this same
      only-object-in-the-world a third person in your home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Third person, indeed! Aunt Hannah, did I? Did I really say such a
      dreadful thing as that? But I didn't know, then, of course. I couldn't
      know how perfectly wonderful a baby is, especially such a baby as Bertram,
      Jr., is. Why, Aunt Hannah, that little thing knows a whole lot already.
      He's known me for weeks; I know he has. And ages and ages ago he began to
      give me little smiles when he saw me. They were smiles&mdash;real smiles!
      Oh, yes, I know nurse said they weren't smiles at the first,&rdquo; admitted
      Billy, in answer to Aunt Hannah's doubting expression. &ldquo;I know nurse said
      it was only wind on his stomach. Think of it&mdash;wind on his stomach!
      Just as if I didn't know the difference between my own baby's smile and
      wind on his stomach! And you don't know how soon he began to follow my
      moving finger with his eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I tried that one day, I remember,&rdquo; observed Aunt Hannah demurely. &ldquo;I
      moved my finger. He looked at the ceiling&mdash;<i>fixedly</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, probably he <i>wanted</i> to look at the ceiling, then,&rdquo; defended
      the young mother, promptly. &ldquo;I'm sure I wouldn't give a snap for a baby if
      he didn't sometimes have a mind of his own, and exercise it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Billy, Billy,&rdquo; laughed Aunt Hannah, with a shake of her head as Billy
      turned away, chin uptilted.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time Bertram, Jr., was three months old, Billy was unmistakably her
      old happy, merry self, strong and well. Affairs at the Strata once more
      were moving as by clockwork&mdash;only this time it was a baby's hand that
      set the clock, and that wound it, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy told her husband very earnestly that now they had entered upon a
      period of Enormous Responsibility. The Life, Character, and Destiny of a
      Human Soul was intrusted to their care, and they must be Wise, Faithful,
      and Efficient. They must be at once Proud and Humble at this their Great
      Opportunity. They must Observe, Learn, and Practice. First and foremost in
      their eyes must always be this wonderful Important Trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram laughed at first very heartily at Billy's instructions, which, he
      declared, were so bristling with capitals that he could fairly see them
      drop from her lips. Then, when he found how really very much in earnest
      she was, and how hurt she was at his levity, he managed to pull his face
      into something like sobriety while she talked to him, though he did
      persist in dropping kisses on her cheeks, her chin, her finger-tips, her
      hair, and the little pink lobes of her ears&mdash;&ldquo;just by way of
      punctuation&rdquo; to her sentences, he said. And he told her that he wasn't
      really slighting her lips, only that they moved so fast he could not catch
      them. Whereat Billy pouted, and told him severely that he was a bad,
      naughty boy, and that he did not deserve to be the father of the dearest,
      most wonderful baby in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know I don't,&rdquo; beamed Bertram, with cheerful unrepentance; &ldquo;but I
      am, just the same,&rdquo; he finished triumphantly. And this time he contrived
      to find his wife's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bertram,&rdquo; sighed Billy, despairingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're an old dear, of course, and one just can't be cross with you; but
      you don't, you just <i>don't</i> realize your Immense Responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I do,&rdquo; maintained Bertram so seriously that even Billy herself
      almost believed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his assertions, however, it must be confessed that Bertram was
      much more inclined to regard the new member of his family as just his son
      rather than as an Important Trust; and there is little doubt that he liked
      to toss him in the air and hear his gleeful crows of delight, without any
      bother of Observing him at all. As to the Life and Character and Destiny
      intrusted to his care, it is to be feared that Bertram just plain gloried
      in his son, poked him in the ribs, and chuckled him under the chin
      whenever he pleased, and gave never so much as a thought to Character and
      Destiny. It is to be feared, too, that he was Proud without being Humble,
      and that the only Opportunity he really appreciated was the chance to show
      off his wife and baby to some less fortunate fellow-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not so Billy. Billy joined a Mothers' Club and entered a class in
      Child Training with an elaborate system of Charts, Rules, and Tests. She
      subscribed to each new &ldquo;Mothers' Helper,&rdquo; and the like, that she came
      across, devouring each and every one with an eagerness that was tempered
      only by a vague uneasiness at finding so many differences of opinion among
      Those Who Knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undeniably Billy, if not Bertram, was indeed realizing the Enormous
      Responsibility, and was keeping ever before her the Important Trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      In June Bertram took a cottage at the South Shore, and by the time the
      really hot weather arrived the family were well settled. It was only an
      hour away from Boston, and easy of access, but William said he guessed he
      would not go; he would stay in Boston, sleeping at the house, and getting
      his meals at the club, until the middle of July, when he was going down in
      Maine for his usual fishing trip, which he had planned to take a little
      earlier than usual this year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll be so lonesome, Uncle William,&rdquo; Billy demurred, &ldquo;in this great
      house all alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I sha'n't,&rdquo; rejoined Uncle William. &ldquo;I shall only be sleeping
      here, you know,&rdquo; he finished, with a slightly peculiar smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well, perhaps, that Billy did not exactly realize the significance
      of that smile, nor the unconscious emphasis on the word &ldquo;sleeping,&rdquo; for it
      would have troubled her not a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      William, to tell the truth, was quite anticipating that sleeping.
      William's nights had not been exactly restful since the baby came. His
      evenings, too, had not been the peaceful things they were wont to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of Billy's Rules and Tests were strenuously objected to on the part
      of her small son, and the young man did not hesitate to show it. Billy
      said that it was good for the baby to cry, that it developed his lungs;
      but William was very sure that it was not good for <i>him</i>. Certainly,
      when the baby did cry, William never could help hovering near the center
      of disturbance, and he always <i>had</i> to remind Billy that it might be
      a pin, you know, or some cruel thing that was hurting. As if he, William,
      a great strong man, could sit calmly by and smoke a pipe, or lie in his
      comfortable bed and sleep, while that blessed little baby was crying his
      heart out like that! Of course, if one did not <i>know</i> he was crying&mdash;Hence
      William's anticipation of those quiet, restful nights when he could not
      know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon after Billy's arrival at the cottage, Aunt Hannah and Alice
      Greggory came down for a day's visit. Aunt Hannah had been away from
      Boston for several weeks, so it was some time since she had seen the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, but hasn't he grown!&rdquo; she exclaimed, picking the baby up and stooping
      to give him a snuggling kiss. The next instant she almost dropped the
      little fellow, so startling had been Billy's cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, wait, Aunt Hannah, please,&rdquo; Billy was entreating, hurrying to the
      little corner cupboard. In a moment she was back with a small bottle and a
      bit of antiseptic cotton. &ldquo;We always sterilize our lips now before we kiss
      him&mdash;it's so much safer, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah sat down limply, the baby still in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlededee, Billy! What an absurd idea! What have you got in that
      bottle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Aunt Hannah, it's just a little simple listerine,&rdquo; bridled Billy,
      &ldquo;and it isn't absurd at all. It's very sensible. My 'Hygienic Guide for
      Mothers' says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose I may kiss his hand,&rdquo; interposed Aunt Hannah, just a
      little curtly, &ldquo;without subjecting myself to a City Hospital treatment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed shamefacedly, but she still held her ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you can't&mdash;nor even his foot. He might get them in his mouth.
      Aunt Hannah, why does a baby think that everything, from his own toes to
      his father's watch fob and the plush balls on a caller's wrist-bag, is
      made to eat? As if I could sterilize everything, and keep him from getting
      hold of germs somewhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to have a germ-proof room for him,&rdquo; laughed Alice Greggory,
      playfully snapping her fingers at the baby in Aunt Hannah's lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy turned eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did you read about that, too?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I thought it was <i>so</i>
      interesting, and I wondered if I could do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alice stared frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say they actually <i>have</i> such things,&rdquo; she
      challenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I read about them in a magazine,&rdquo; asserted Billy, &ldquo;&mdash;how you
      could have a germ-proof room. They said it was very simple, too. Just
      pasteurize the air, you know, by heating it to one hundred and ten and
      one-half degrees Fahrenheit for seventeen and one-half minutes. I remember
      just the figures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple, indeed! It sounds so,&rdquo; scoffed Aunt Hannah, with uplifted
      eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I couldn't do it, of course,&rdquo; admitted Billy, regretfully.
      &ldquo;Bertram never'd stand for that in the world. He's always rushing in to
      show the baby off to every Tom, Dick and Harry and his wife that comes;
      and of course if you opened the nursery door, that would let in those germ
      things, and you <i>couldn't</i> very well pasteurize your callers by
      heating them to one hundred and ten and one-half degrees for seventeen and
      one-half minutes! I don't see how you could manage such a room, anyway,
      unless you had a system of&mdash;of rooms like locks, same as they do for
      water in canals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my grief and conscience&mdash;locks, indeed!&rdquo; almost groaned Aunt
      Hannah. &ldquo;Here, Alice, will you please take this child&mdash;that is, if
      you have a germ-proof certificate about you to show to his mother. I want
      to take off my bonnet and gloves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him? Of course I'll take him,&rdquo; laughed Alice; &ldquo;and right under his
      mother's nose, too,&rdquo; she added, with a playful grimace at Billy. &ldquo;And
      we'll make pat-a-cakes, and send the little pigs to market, and have such
      a beautiful time that we'll forget there ever was such a thing in the
      world as an old germ. Eh, babykins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babykins&rdquo; cooed his unqualified approval of this plan; but his mother
      looked troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, Alice. You may play with him,&rdquo; she frowned doubtfully;
      &ldquo;but you mustn't do it long, you know&mdash;not over five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five minutes! Well, I like that, when I've come all the way from Boston
      purposely to see him,&rdquo; pouted Alice. &ldquo;What's the matter now? Time for his
      nap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not for&mdash;thirteen minutes,&rdquo; replied Billy, consulting the
      watch at her belt. &ldquo;But we never play with Baby more than five minutes at
      a time. My 'Scientific Care of Infants' says it isn't wise; that with some
      babies it's positively dangerous, until after they're six months old. It
      makes them nervous, and forces their mind, you know,&rdquo; she explained
      anxiously. &ldquo;So of course we'd want to be careful. Bertram, Jr., isn't
      quite four, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, of course,&rdquo; murmured Alice, politely, stopping a pat-a-cake
      before it was half baked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infant, as if suspecting that he was being deprived of his lawful baby
      rights, began to fret and whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor itty sing,&rdquo; crooned Aunt Hannah, who, having divested herself of
      bonnet and gloves, came hurriedly forward with outstretched hands. &ldquo;Do
      they just 'buse 'em? Come here to your old auntie, sweetems, and we'll go
      walkee. I saw a bow-wow&mdash;such a tunnin' ickey wickey bow-wow on the
      steps when I came in. Come, we go see ickey wickey bow-wow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Hannah, <i>please!</i>&rdquo; protested Billy, both hands upraised in
      horror. &ldquo;<i>Won't</i> you say 'dog,' and leave out that dreadful 'ickey
      wickey'? Of course he can't understand things now, really, but we never
      know when he'll begin to, and we aren't ever going to let him hear
      baby-talk at all, if we can help it. And truly, when you come to think of
      it, it is absurd to expect a child to talk sensibly and rationally on the
      mental diet of 'moo-moos' and 'choo-choos' served out to them. Our
      Professor of Metaphysics and Ideology in our Child Study Course says that
      nothing is so receptive and plastic as the Mind of a Little Child, and
      that it is perfectly appalling how we fill it with trivial absurdities
      that haven't even the virtue of being accurate. So that's why we're trying
      to be so careful with Baby. You didn't mind my speaking, I know, Aunt
      Hannah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, of course not, Billy,&rdquo; retorted Aunt Hannah, a little tartly, and
      with a touch of sarcasm most unlike her gentle self. &ldquo;I'm sure I shouldn't
      wish to fill this infant's plastic mind with anything so appalling as
      trivial inaccuracies. May I be pardoned for suggesting, however,&rdquo; she went
      on as the baby's whimper threatened to become a lusty wail, &ldquo;that this
      young gentleman cries as if he were sleepy and hungry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is,&rdquo; admitted Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, doesn't your system of scientific training allow him to be given
      such trivial absurdities as food and naps?&rdquo; inquired the lady, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it does, Aunt Hannah,&rdquo; retorted Billy, laughing in spite of
      herself. &ldquo;And it's almost time now. There are only a few more minutes to
      wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Few more minutes to wait, indeed!&rdquo; scorned Aunt Hannah. &ldquo;I suppose the
      poor little fellow might cry and cry, and you wouldn't set that clock
      ahead by a teeny weeny minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said the young mother, decisively. &ldquo;My 'Daily Guide for
      Mothers' says that a time for everything and everything in its time, is
      the very A B C and whole alphabet of Right Training. He does everything by
      the clock, and to the minute,&rdquo; declared Billy, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah sniffed, obviously skeptical and rebellious. Alice Greggory
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Hannah looks as if she'd like to bring down her clock that strikes
      half an hour ahead,&rdquo; she said mischievously; but Aunt Hannah did not deign
      to answer this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you rock him?&rdquo; she demanded of Billy. &ldquo;I suppose I may do
      that, mayn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, I don't rock him at all, Aunt Hannah,&rdquo; exclaimed Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor sing to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did&mdash;before I went away. I remember that you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know I did,&rdquo; admitted Billy, &ldquo;and I had an awful time, too. Some
      evenings, every single one of us, even to Uncle William, had to try before
      we could get him off to sleep. But that was before I got my 'Efficiency of
      Mother and Child,' or my 'Scientific Training,' and, oh, lots of others.
      You see, I didn't know a thing then, and I loved to rock him, so I did it&mdash;though
      the nurse said it wasn't good for him; but I didn't believe <i>her</i>.
      I've had an awful time changing; but I've done it. I just put him in his
      little crib, or his carriage, and after a while he goes to sleep.
      Sometimes, now, he doesn't cry hardly any. I'm afraid, to-day, though, he
      will,&rdquo; she worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm afraid he will,&rdquo; almost screamed Aunt Hannah, in order to make
      herself heard above Bertram, Jr., who, by this time, was voicing his
      opinion of matters and things in no uncertain manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, after all, so very long before peace and order reigned; and,
      in due course, Bertram, Jr., in his carriage, lay fast asleep. Then, while
      Aunt Hannah went to Billy's room for a short rest, Billy and Alice went
      out on to the wide veranda which faced the wonderful expanse of sky and
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me of yourself,&rdquo; commanded Billy, almost at once. &ldquo;It's been
      ages since I've heard or seen a thing of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! But there must be,&rdquo; insisted Billy. &ldquo;You know it's months since
      I've seen anything of you, hardly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. We feel quite neglected at the Annex,&rdquo; said Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't go anywhere,&rdquo; defended Billy. &ldquo;I can't. There isn't time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even to bring us the extra happiness?&rdquo; smiled Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick change came to Billy's face. Her eyes glowed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; though I've had so much that ought to have gone&mdash;such loads and
      loads of extra happiness, which I couldn't possibly use myself! Sometimes
      I'm so happy, Alice, that&mdash;that I'm just frightened. It doesn't seem
      as if anybody ought to be so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Billy, dear,&rdquo; demurred Alice, her eyes filling suddenly with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've got the Annex. I'm glad I've got that for the overflow,
      anyway,&rdquo; resumed Billy, trying to steady her voice. &ldquo;I've sent a whole lot
      of happiness up there mentally, if I haven't actually carried it; so I'm
      sure you must have got it. Now tell me of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing to tell,&rdquo; insisted Alice, as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're working as hard as ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;harder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New pupils?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and some concert engagements&mdash;good ones, for next season.
      Accompaniments, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I've heard of you already twice, lately, in that line, and very
      flatteringly, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you? Well, that's good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm-m.&rdquo; There was a moment's silence, then, abruptly, Billy changed the
      subject. &ldquo;I had a letter from Belle Calderwell, yesterday.&rdquo; She paused
      expectantly, but there was no comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't seem interested,&rdquo; she frowned, after a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, but&mdash;I don't know the Lady, you see. Was it a good
      letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know her brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true.&rdquo; Alice's cheeks showed a deeper color. &ldquo;Did she say anything
      of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She said he was coming back to Boston next winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She says that this time he declares he really <i>is</i> going to
      settle down to work,&rdquo; murmured Billy, demurely, with a sidelong glance at
      her companion. &ldquo;She says he's engaged to be married&mdash;one of her
      friends over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply. Alice appeared to be absorbed in watching a tiny white
      sail far out at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Billy was silent. Then, with studied carelessness, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you know Mr. Arkwright, too. She told of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? Well, what of him?&rdquo; Alice's voice was studiedly indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there was quite a lot of him. Belle had just been to hear him sing,
      and then her brother had introduced him to her. She thinks he's perfectly
      wonderful, in every way, I should judge. In fact, she simply raved over
      him. It seems that while we've been hearing nothing from him all winter,
      he's been winning no end of laurels for himself in Paris and Berlin. He's
      been studying, too, of course, as well as singing; and now he's got a
      chance to sing somewhere&mdash;create a rôle, or something&mdash;Belle
      said she wasn't quite clear on the matter herself, but it was a perfectly
      splendid chance, and one that was a fine feather in his cap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he won't be coming home&mdash;that is, to Boston&mdash;at all this
      winter, probably,&rdquo; said Alice, with a cheerfulness that sounded just a
      little forced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until February. But he is coming then. He's been engaged for six
      performances with the Boston Opera Company&mdash;as a star tenor, mind
      you! Isn't that splendid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; murmured Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belle writes that Hugh says he's improved wonderfully, and that even he
      can see that his singing is marvelous. He says Paris is wild over him; but&mdash;for
      my part, I wish he'd come home and stay here where he belongs,&rdquo; finished
      Billy, a bit petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why, Billy!&rdquo; murmured her friend, a curiously startled look coming
      into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; maintained Billy; then, recklessly, she added: &ldquo;I had such
      beautiful plans for him, once, Alice. Oh, if you only could have cared for
      him, you'd have made such a splendid couple!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vivid scarlet flew to Alice's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she cried, getting quickly to her feet and bending over one of
      the flower boxes along the veranda railing. &ldquo;Mr. Arkwright never thought
      of marrying me&mdash;and I'm not going to marry anybody but my music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy sighed despairingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that's what you say now; but if&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped abruptly.
      Around the turn of the veranda had appeared Aunt Hannah, wheeling Bertram,
      Jr., still asleep in his carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came out the other door,&rdquo; she explained softly. &ldquo;And it was so lovely I
      just had to go in and get the baby. I thought it would be so nice for him
      to finish his nap out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy arose with a troubled frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Aunt Hannah, he mustn't&mdash;he can't stay out here. I'm sorry, but
      we'll have to take him back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hannah's eyes grew mutinous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought the outdoor air was just the thing for him. I'm sure your
      scientific hygienic nonsense says <i>that!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do&mdash;they did&mdash;that is, some of them do,&rdquo; acknowledged
      Billy, worriedly; &ldquo;but they differ, so! And the one I'm going by now says
      that Baby should always sleep in an <i>even</i> temperature&mdash;seventy
      degrees, if possible; and that's exactly what the room in there was, when
      I left him. It's not the same out here, I'm sure. In fact I looked at the
      thermometer to see, just before I came out myself. So, Aunt Hannah, I'm
      afraid I'll have to take him back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you used to have him sleep out of doors all the time, on that little
      balcony out of your room,&rdquo; argued Aunt Hannah, still plainly unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know I did. I was following the other man's rules, then. As I
      said, if only they wouldn't differ so! Of course I want the best; but it's
      so hard to always know the best, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this very inopportune moment Master Bertram took occasion to wake up,
      which brought even a deeper wrinkle of worry to his fond mother's
      forehead; for she said that, according to the clock, he should have been
      sleeping exactly ten and one-half more minutes, and that of course he
      couldn't commence the next thing until those ten and one-half minutes were
      up, or else his entire schedule for the day would be shattered. So what
      she should do with him for those should-have-been-sleeping ten minutes and
      a half, she did not know. All of which drew from Aunt Hannah the
      astounding exclamation of:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my grief and conscience, Billy, if you aren't the&mdash;the limit!&rdquo;
       Which, indeed, she must have been, to have brought circumspect Aunt Hannah
      to the point of actually using slang.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. A NIGHT OFF
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Henshaw family did not return to the Strata until late in September.
      Billy said that the sea air seemed to agree so well with the baby it would
      be a pity to change until the weather became really too cool at the shore
      to be comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      William came back from his fishing trip in August, and resumed his old
      habit of sleeping at the house and taking his meals at the club. To be
      sure, for a week he went back and forth between the city and the beach
      house; but it happened to be a time when Bertram, Jr., was cutting a
      tooth, and this so wore upon William's sympathy&mdash;William still could
      not help insisting it <i>might</i> be a pin&mdash;that he concluded peace
      lay only in flight. So he went back to the Strata.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram had stayed at the cottage all summer, painting industriously.
      Heretofore he had taken more of a vacation through the summer months, but
      this year there seemed to be nothing for him to do but to paint. He did
      not like to go away on a trip and leave Billy, and she declared she could
      not take the baby nor leave him, and that she did not need any trip,
      anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then, we'll just stay at the beach, and have a fine vacation
      together,&rdquo; he had answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Bertram saw it, however, he could detect very little &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; to it.
      Billy had no time for anything but the baby. When she was not actually
      engaged in caring for it, she was studying how to care for it. Never had
      she been sweeter or dearer, and never had Bertram loved her half so well.
      He was proud, too, of her devotion, and of her triumphant success as a
      mother; but he did wish that sometimes, just once in a while, she would
      remember she was a wife, and pay a little attention to him, her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram was ashamed to own it, even to himself, but he was feeling just a
      little abused that summer; and he knew that, in his heart, he was actually
      getting jealous of his own son, in spite of his adoration of the little
      fellow. He told himself defensively that it was not to be expected that he
      should not want the love of his wife, the attentions of his wife, and the
      companionship of his wife&mdash;a part of the time. It was nothing more
      than natural that occasionally he should like to see her show some
      interest in subjects not mentioned in Mothers' Guides and Scientific
      Trainings of Infants; and he did not believe he could be blamed for
      wanting his residence to be a home for himself as well as a nursery for
      his offspring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even while he thus discontentedly argued with himself, however, Bertram
      called himself a selfish brute just to think such things when he had so
      dear and loving a wife as Billy, and so fine and splendid a baby as
      Bertram, Jr. He told himself, too, that very likely when they were back in
      their own house again, and when motherhood was not so new to her, Billy
      would not be so absorbed in the baby. She would return to her old interest
      in her husband, her music, her friends, and her own personal appearance.
      Meanwhile there was always, of course, for him, his painting. So he would
      paint, accepting gladly what crumbs of attention fell from the baby's
      table, and trust to the future to make Billy none the less a mother,
      perhaps, but a little more the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just how confidently he was counting on this coming change, Bertram hardly
      realized himself; but certainly the family was scarcely settled at the
      Strata before the husband gayly proposed one evening that he and Billy
      should go to the theater to see &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy was clearly both surprised and shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Bertram, I can't&mdash;you know I can't!&rdquo; she exclaimed reprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram's heart sank; but he kept a brave front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a question! As if I'd leave Baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Billy, dear, you'd be gone less than three hours, and you say
      Delia's the most careful of nurses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy's forehead puckered into an anxious frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it. Something might happen to him, Bertram. I couldn't be
      happy a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dearest, aren't you <i>ever</i> going to leave him?&rdquo; demanded the
      young husband, forlornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, of course, when it's reasonable and necessary. I went out to
      the Annex yesterday afternoon. I was gone almost two whole hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, did anything happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no; but then I telephoned, you see, several times, so I <i>knew</i>
      everything was all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, if that's all you want, I could telephone, you know, between
      every act,&rdquo; suggested Bertram, with a sarcasm that was quite lost on the
      earnest young mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-yes, you could do that, couldn't you?&rdquo; conceded Billy; &ldquo;and, of course,
      I <i>haven't</i> been anywhere much, lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I could,&rdquo; agreed Bertram, with a promptness that carefully hid his
      surprise at her literal acceptance of what he had proposed as a huge joke.
      &ldquo;Come, is it a go? Shall I telephone to see if I can get seats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think Baby'll surely be all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you'll telephone home between every act?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; Bertram's voice sounded almost as if he were repeating the
      marriage service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we'll come straight home afterwards as fast as John and Peggy can
      bring us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I think&mdash;I'll&mdash;go,&rdquo; breathed Billy, tremulously, plainly
      showing what a momentous concession she thought she was making. &ldquo;I do love
      'Romeo and Juliet,' and I haven't seen it for ages!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Then I'll find out about the tickets,&rdquo; cried Bertram, so elated at
      the prospect of having an old-time evening out with his wife that even the
      half-hourly telephones did not seem too great a price to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came, they were a little late in starting. Baby was fretful,
      and though Billy usually laid him in his crib and unhesitatingly left the
      room, insisting that he should go to sleep by himself in accordance with
      the most approved rules in her Scientific Training; yet to-night she could
      not bring herself to the point of leaving the house until he was quiet.
      Hurried as they were when they did start, Billy was conscious of Bertram's
      frowning disapproval of her frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't like it, of course, dear, and I don't blame you,&rdquo; she smiled
      remorsefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I like it&mdash;that is, I did, when it was new,&rdquo; rejoined her
      husband, with apologetic frankness. &ldquo;But, dear, didn't you have anything
      else? This looks almost&mdash;well, mussy, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;well, yes, maybe there were others,&rdquo; admitted Billy; &ldquo;but this
      was the quickest and easiest to get into, and it all came just as I was
      getting Baby ready for bed, you know. I am a fright, though, I'll
      acknowledge, so far as clothes go. I haven't had time to get a thing since
      Baby came. I must get something right away, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; declared Bertram, with emphasis, hurrying his wife into the
      waiting automobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy had to apologize again at the theater, for the curtain had already
      risen on the ancient quarrel between the houses of Capulet and Montague,
      and Billy knew her husband's special abhorrence of tardy arrivals. Later,
      though, when well established in their seats, Billy's mind was plainly not
      with the players on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose Baby <i>is</i> all right?&rdquo; she whispered, after a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh-h! Of course he is, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief silence, during which Billy peered at her program in the
      semi-darkness. Then she nudged her husband's arm ecstatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram, I couldn't have chosen a better play if I'd tried. There are <i>five</i>
      acts! I'd forgotten there were so many. That means you can telephone four
      times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo; Bertram's voice was sternly cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be sure they tell you exactly how Baby is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, dear. Sh-h! Here's Romeo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy subsided. She even clapped a little in spasmodic enthusiasm.
      Presently she peered at her program again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There wouldn't be time, I suppose, to telephone between the scenes,&rdquo; she
      hazarded wistfully. &ldquo;There are sixteen of those!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hardly! Billy, you aren't paying one bit of attention to the play!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course I am,&rdquo; whispered Billy, indignantly. &ldquo;I think it's
      perfectly lovely, and I'm perfectly contented, too&mdash;since I found out
      about those five acts, and as long as I <i>can't</i> have the sixteen
      scenes,&rdquo; she added, settling back in her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if to prove that she was interested in the play, her next whisper, some
      time later, had to do with one of the characters on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's that&mdash;the nurse? Mercy! We wouldn't want her for Baby, would
      we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself Bertram chuckled this time. Billy, too, laughed at
      herself. Then, resolutely, she settled into her seat again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain was not fairly down on the first act before Billy had laid an
      urgent hand on her husband's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, remember; ask if he's waked up, or anything,&rdquo; she directed. &ldquo;And be
      sure to say I'll come right home if they need me. Now hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo; Bertram rose with alacrity. &ldquo;I'll be back right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I don't want you to hurry <i>too</i> much,&rdquo; she called after him,
      softly. &ldquo;I want you to take plenty of time to ask questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; nodded Bertram, with a quizzical smile, as he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obediently Bertram asked all the question she could think of, then came
      back to his wife. There was nothing in his report that even Billy could
      disapprove of, or worry about; and with almost a contented look on her
      face she turned toward the stage as the curtain went up on the second act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love this balcony scene,&rdquo; she sighed happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romeo, however, had not half finished his impassioned love-making when
      Billy clutched her husband's arm almost fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram,&rdquo; she fairly hissed in a tragic whisper, &ldquo;I've just happened to
      think! Won't it be awful when Baby falls in love? I know I shall just hate
      that girl for taking him away from me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh-h! <i>Billy!</i>&rdquo; expostulated her husband, choking with half-stifled
      laughter. &ldquo;That woman in front heard you, I know she did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall,&rdquo; sighed Billy, mournfully, turning back to the stage.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;'Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow,
     That I shall say good night, till it be morrow,&rdquo;'
</pre>
    <p>
      sighed Juliet passionately to her Romeo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! I hope not,&rdquo; whispered Billy flippantly in Bertram's ear. &ldquo;I'm
      sure I don't want to stay here till to-morrow! I want to go home and see
      Baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Billy!</i>&rdquo; pleaded Bertram so despairingly, that Billy, really
      conscience-smitten, sat back in her seat and remained, for the rest of the
      act, very quiet indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deceived by her apparent tranquillity, Bertram turned as the curtain went
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Billy, surely you don't think it'll be necessary to telephone so
      soon as this again,&rdquo; he ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy's countenance fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Bertram, you <i>said</i> you would! Of course if you aren't willing
      to&mdash;but I've been counting on hearing all through this horrid long
      act, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness me, Billy, I'll telephone every minute for you, of course, if
      you want me to,&rdquo; cried Bertram, springing to his feet, and trying not to
      show his impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was back more promptly this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything O. K.,&rdquo; he smiled reassuringly into Billy's anxious eyes.
      &ldquo;Delia said she'd just been up, and the little chap was sound asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the man's unbounded surprise, his wife grew actually white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up! Up!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you mean that Delia went down-stairs to <i>stay</i>,
      and left my baby up there alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Billy, she said he was all right,&rdquo; murmured Bertram, softly, casting
      uneasy sidelong glances at his too interested neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'All right'! Perhaps he was, <i>then</i>&mdash;but he may not be, later.
      Delia should stay in the next room all the time, where she could hear the
      least thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, she will, I'm sure, if you tell her to,&rdquo; soothed Bertram,
      quickly. &ldquo;It'll be all right next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy shook her head. She was obviously near to crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Bertram, I can't stand it to sit here enjoying myself all safe and
      comfortable, and know that Baby is <i>alone</i> up there in that great big
      room! Please, <i>please</i> won't you go and telephone Delia to go up <i>now</i>
      and stay there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram, weary, sorely tried, and increasingly aware of those annoyingly
      interested neighbors, was on the point of saying a very decided no; but a
      glance into Billy's pleading eyes settled it. Without a word he went back
      to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain was up when he slipped into his seat, very red of face. In
      answer to Billy's hurried whisper he shook his head; but in the short
      pause between the first and second scenes he said, in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, Billy, but I couldn't get the house at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't get them! But you'd just been talking with them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's exactly it, probably. I had just telephoned, so they weren't
      watching for the bell. Anyhow, I couldn't get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you didn't get Delia at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Baby is still&mdash;all alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he's all right, dear. Delia's keeping watch of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was silence; then, with clear decisiveness came Billy's
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram, I am going home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, for heaven's sake don't be a silly goose! The play's half over
      already. We'll soon be going, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy's lips came together in a thin little determined line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram, I am going home now, please,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You needn't come with
      me; I can go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram said two words under his breath which it was just as well,
      perhaps, that Billy&mdash;and the neighbors&mdash;did not hear; then he
      gathered up their wraps and, with Billy, stalked out of the theater.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home everything was found to be absolutely as it should be. Bertram,
      Jr., was peacefully sleeping, and Delia, who had come up from downstairs,
      was sewing in the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you see,&rdquo; observed Bertram, a little sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy drew a long, contented sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see; everything is all right. But that's exactly what I wanted to
      do, Bertram, you know&mdash;to <i>see for myself</i>,&rdquo; she finished
      happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Bertram, looking at her rapt face as she hovered over the baby's crib,
      called himself a brute and a beast to mind <i>anything</i> that could make
      Billy look like that.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. &ldquo;SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Bertram did not ask Billy very soon again to go to the theater. For some
      days, indeed, he did not ask her to do anything. Then, one evening, he did
      beg for some music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, you haven't played to me or sung to me since I could remember,&rdquo; he
      complained. &ldquo;I want some music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy gave a merry laugh and wriggled her fingers experimentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, Bertram! I don't believe I could play a note. You know I'm all out
      of practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why <i>don't</i> you practice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Bertram, I can't. In the first place I don't seem to have any time
      except when Baby's asleep; and I can't play then-I'd wake him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram sighed irritably, rose to his feet, and began to walk up and down
      the room. He came to a pause at last, his eyes bent a trifle
      disapprovingly on his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, dear, <i>don't</i> you wear anything but those wrapper things
      nowadays?&rdquo; he asked plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Billy laughed. But this time a troubled frown followed the laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Bertram, I suppose they do look dowdy, sometimes,&rdquo; she confessed;
      &ldquo;but, you see, I hate to wear a really good dress&mdash;Baby rumples them
      up so; and I'm usually in a hurry to get to him mornings, and these are so
      easy to slip into, and so much more comfortable for me to handle him in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, of course; I see,&rdquo; mumbled Bertram, listlessly taking up
      his walk again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, after a moment's silence, began to talk animatedly. Baby had done a
      wonderfully cunning thing that morning, and Billy had not had a chance yet
      to tell Bertram. Baby was growing more and more cunning anyway, these
      days, and there were several things she believed she had not told him; so
      she told them now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram listened politely, interestedly. He told himself that he <i>was</i>
      interested, too. Of course he was interested in the doings of his own
      child! But he still walked up and down the room a little restlessly,
      coming to a halt at last by the window, across which the shade had not
      been drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; he cried suddenly, with his old boyish eagerness, &ldquo;there's a
      glorious moon. Come on! Let's take a little walk&mdash;a real
      fellow-and-his-best-girl walk! Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! dear, I couldn't,&rdquo; cried Billy springing to her feet. &ldquo;I'd love
      to, though, if I could,&rdquo; she added hastily, as she saw disappointment
      cloud her husband's face. &ldquo;But I told Delia she might go out. It isn't her
      regular evening, of course, but I told her I didn't mind staying with Baby
      a bit. So I'll have to go right up now. She'll be going soon. But, dear,
      you go and take your walk. It'll do you good. Then you can come back and
      tell me all about it&mdash;only you must come in quietly, so not to wake
      the baby,&rdquo; she finished, giving her husband an affectionate kiss, as she
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a disconsolate five minutes of solitude, Bertram got his hat and
      coat and went out for his walk&mdash;but he told himself he did not expect
      to enjoy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram Henshaw knew that the old rebellious jealousy of the summer had
      him fast in its grip. He was heartily ashamed of himself, but he could not
      help it. He wanted Billy, and he wanted her then. He wanted to talk to
      her. He wanted to tell her about a new portrait commission he had just
      obtained; and he wanted to ask her what she thought of the idea of a
      brand-new &ldquo;Face of a Girl&rdquo; for the Bohemian Ten Exhibition next March. He
      wanted&mdash;but then, what would be the use? She would listen, of course,
      but he would know by the very looks of her face that she would not be
      really thinking of what he was saying; and he would be willing to wager
      his best canvas that in the very first pause she would tell about the
      baby's newest tooth or latest toy. Not but that he liked to hear about the
      little fellow, of course; and not but that he was proud as Punch of him,
      too; but that he would like sometimes to hear Billy talk of something
      else. The sweetest melody in the world, if dinned into one's ears day and
      night, became something to be fled from.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Billy ought to talk of something else, too! Bertram, Jr., wonderful as
      he was, really was not the only thing in the world, or even the only baby;
      and other people&mdash;outsiders, their friends&mdash;had a right to
      expect that sometimes other matters might be considered&mdash;their own,
      for instance. But Billy seemed to have forgotten this. No matter whether
      the subject of conversation had to do with the latest novel or a trip to
      Europe, under Billy's guidance it invariably led straight to Baby's
      Jack-and-Jill book, or to a perambulator journey in the Public Garden. If
      it had not been so serious, it would have been really funny the way all
      roads led straight to one goal. He himself, when alone with Billy, had
      started the most unusual and foreign subjects, sometimes, just to see if
      there were not somewhere a little bypath that did not bring up in his own
      nursery. He never, however, found one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not funny; it was serious. Was this glorious gift on parenthood
      to which he had looked forward as the crowning joy of his existence, to be
      nothing but a tragedy that would finally wreck his domestic happiness? It
      could not be. It must not be. He must be patient, and wait. Billy loved
      him. He was sure she did. By and by this obsession of motherhood, which
      had her so fast in its grasp, would relax. She would remember that her
      husband had rights as well as her child. Once again she would give him the
      companionship, love, and sympathetic interest so dear to him. Meanwhile
      there was his work. He must bury himself in that. And fortunate, indeed,
      he was, he told himself, that he had something so absorbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point in his meditations that Bertram rounded a corner and
      came face to face with a man who stopped him short with a jovial:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it&mdash;by George, it is Bertie Henshaw! Well, what do you think
      of that for luck?&mdash;and me only two days home from 'Gay Paree'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Seaver! How are you? You <i>are</i> a stranger!&rdquo; Bertram's voice and
      handshake were a bit more cordial than they would have been had he not at
      the moment been feeling so abused and forlorn. In the old days he had
      liked this Bob Seaver well. Seaver was an artist like himself, and was
      good company always. But Seaver and his crowd were a little too Bohemian
      for William's taste; and after Billy came, she, too, had objected to what
      she called &ldquo;that horrid Seaver man.&rdquo; In his heart, Bertram knew that there
      was good foundation for their objections, so he had avoided Seaver for a
      time; and for some years, now, the man had been abroad, somewhat to
      Bertram's relief. To-night, however, Seaver's genial smile and hearty
      friendliness were like a sudden burst of sunshine on a rainy day&mdash;and
      Bertram detested rainy days. He was feeling now, too, as if he had just
      had a whole week of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am something of a stranger here,&rdquo; nodded Seaver. &ldquo;But I tell you
      what, little old Boston looks mighty good to me, all the same. Come on!
      You're just the fellow we want. I'm on my way now to the old stamping
      ground. Come&mdash;right about face, old chap, and come with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry&mdash;but I guess I can't, to-night,&rdquo; he sighed. Both gesture and
      words were unhesitating, but the voice carried the discontent of a small
      boy, who, while the sun is still shining, has been told to come into the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rats! Yes, you can, too. Come on! Lots of the old crowd will be there&mdash;Griggs,
      Beebe, Jack Jenkins, and Tully. We need you to complete the show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack Jenkins? Is he here?&rdquo; A new eagerness had come into Bertram's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! He came on from New York last night. Great boy, Jenkins! Just back
      from Paris fairly covered with medals, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so I hear. I haven't seen him for four years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better come to-night then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; began Bertram, with obvious reluctance. &ldquo;It's already nine
      o'clock, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine o'clock!&rdquo; cut in Seaver, with a broad grin. &ldquo;Since when has your
      limit been nine o'clock? I've seen the time when you didn't mind nine
      o'clock in the morning, Bertie! What's got&mdash;Oh, I remember. I met
      another friend of yours in Berlin; chap named Arkwright&mdash;and say,
      he's some singer, you bet! You're going to hear of him one of these days.
      Well, he told me all about how you'd settled down now&mdash;son and heir,
      fireside bliss, pretty wife, and all the fixings. But, I say, Bertie,
      doesn't she let you out&mdash;<i>any</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Seaver!&rdquo; flared Bertram in annoyed wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, why don't you come to-night? If you want to see Jenkins
      you'll have to; he's going back to New York to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For only a brief minute longer did Bertram hesitate; then he turned
      squarely about with an air of finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he? Well, then, perhaps I will,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'd hate to miss Jenkins
      entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed his companion, as they fell into step. &ldquo;Have a cigar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Don't mind if I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Bertram's chin was a little higher and his step a little more decided
      than usual, it was all merely by way of accompaniment to his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly it was right that he should go, and it was sensible. Indeed, it
      was really almost imperative&mdash;due to Billy, as it were&mdash;after
      that disagreeable taunt of Seaver's. As if she did not want him to go when
      and where he pleased! As if she would consent for a moment to figure in
      the eyes of his friends as a tyrannical wife who objected to her husband's
      passing a social evening with his friends! To be sure, in this particular
      case, she might not favor Seaver's presence, but even she would not mind
      this once&mdash;and, anyhow, it was Jenkins that was the attraction, not
      Seaver. Besides, he himself was no undeveloped boy now. He was a man,
      presumedly able to take care of himself. Besides, again, had not Billy
      herself told him to go out and enjoy the evening without her, as she had
      to stay with the baby? He would telephone her, of course, that he had met
      some old friends, and that he might be late; then she would not worry.
    </p>
    <p>
      And forthwith, having settled the matter in his mind, and to his complete
      satisfaction, Bertram gave his undivided attention to Seaver, who had
      already plunged into an account of a recent Art Exhibition he had attended
      in Paris.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. GHOSTS THAT WALKED FOR BERTRAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      October proved to be unusually mild, and about the middle of the month,
      Bertram, after much unselfish urging on the part of Billy, went to a
      friend's camp in the Adirondacks for a week's stay. He came back with an
      angry, lugubrious face&mdash;and a broken arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bertram! And your right one, too&mdash;the same one you broke
      before!&rdquo; mourned Billy, tearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; retorted Bertram, trying in vain to give an air of jauntiness
      to his reply. &ldquo;Didn't want to be too changeable, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you do it, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fell into a silly little hole covered with underbrush. But&mdash;oh,
      Billy, what's the use? I did it, and I can't undo it&mdash;more's the
      pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you can't, you poor boy,&rdquo; sympathized Billy; &ldquo;and you sha'n't
      be tormented with questions. We'll just be thankful 'twas no worse. You
      can't paint for a while, of course; but we won't mind that. It'll just
      give Baby and me a chance to have you all to ourselves for a time, and
      we'll love that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; sighed Bertram, so abstractedly that Billy bridled with
      pretty resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I like your enthusiasm, sir,&rdquo; she frowned. &ldquo;I'm afraid you don't
      appreciate the blessings you do have, young man! Did you realize what I
      said? I remarked that you could be with <i>Baby</i> and <i>me</i>,&rdquo; she
      emphasized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram laughed, and gave his wife an affectionate kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do appreciate my blessings, dear&mdash;when those blessings are
      such treasures as you and Baby, but&mdash;&rdquo; Only his doleful eyes fixed on
      his injured arm finished his sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, dear, of course, and I understand,&rdquo; murmured Billy, all
      tenderness at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not easy for Bertram&mdash;those following days. Once again he
      was obliged to accept the little intimate personal services that he so
      disliked. Once again he could do nothing but read, or wander
      disconsolately into his studio and gaze at his half-finished &ldquo;Face of a
      Girl.&rdquo; Occasionally, it is true, driven nearly to desperation by the
      haunting vision in his mind's eye, he picked up a brush and attempted to
      make his left hand serve his will; but a bare half-dozen irritating,
      ineffectual strokes were usually enough to make him throw down his brush
      in disgust. He never could do anything with his left hand, he told himself
      dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of his hours, of course, he spent with Billy and his son, and they
      were happy hours, too; but they always came to be restless ones before the
      day was half over. Billy was always devotion itself to him&mdash;when she
      was not attending to the baby; he had no fault to find with Billy. And the
      baby was delightful&mdash;he could find no fault with the baby. But the
      baby <i>was</i> fretful&mdash;he was teething, Billy said&mdash;and he
      needed a great deal of attention; so, naturally, Bertram drifted out of
      the nursery, after a time, and went down into his studio, where were his
      dear, empty palette, his orderly brushes, and his tantalizing &ldquo;Face of a
      Girl.&rdquo; From the studio, generally, Bertram went out on to the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he dropped into a fellow-artist's studio. Sometimes he strolled
      into a club or café where he knew he would be likely to find some friend
      who would help him while away a tiresome hour. Bertram's friends quite
      vied with each other in rendering this sort of aid, so much so, indeed,
      that&mdash;naturally, perhaps&mdash;Bertram came to call on their services
      more and more frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Particularly was this the case when, after the splints were removed,
      Bertram found, as the days passed, that his arm was not improving as it
      should improve. This not only disappointed and annoyed him, but worried
      him. He remembered sundry disquieting warnings given by the physician at
      the time of the former break&mdash;warnings concerning the probable
      seriousness of a repetition of the injury. To Billy, of course, Bertram
      said nothing of all this; but just before Christmas he went to see a noted
      specialist.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, almost in front of the learned surgeon's door, Bertram met
      Bob Seaver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott, Bertie, what's up?&rdquo; ejaculated Seaver. &ldquo;You look as if you'd
      seen a ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; answered Bertram, with grim bitterness. &ldquo;I've seen the ghost of&mdash;of
      every 'Face of a Girl' I ever painted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gorry! So bad as that? No wonder you look as if you'd been disporting in
      graveyards,&rdquo; chuckled Seaver, laughing at his own joke &ldquo;What's the matter&mdash;arm
      on a rampage to day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for reply, but as Bertram did not answer at once, he resumed,
      with gay insistence: &ldquo;Come on! You need cheering up. Suppose we go down to
      Trentini's and see who's there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Bertram, dully. &ldquo;Suit yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram was not thinking of Seaver, Trentini's, or whom he might find
      there. Bertram was thinking of certain words he had heard less than half
      an hour ago. He was wondering, too, if ever again he could think of
      anything but those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth?&rdquo; the great surgeon had said. &ldquo;Well, the truth is&mdash;I'm
      sorry to tell you the truth, Mr. Henshaw, but if you will have it&mdash;you've
      painted the last picture you'll ever paint with your right hand, I fear.
      It's a bad case. This break, coming as it did on top of the serious injury
      of two or three years ago, was bad enough; but, to make matters worse, the
      bone was imperfectly set and wrongly treated, which could not be helped,
      of course, as you were miles away from skilled surgeons at the time of the
      injury. We'll do the best we can, of course; but&mdash;well, you asked for
      the truth, you remember; so I had to give it to you.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. THE MOTHER&mdash;THE WIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bertram made up his mind at once that, for the present, at least, he would
      tell no one what the surgeon had said to him. He had placed himself under
      the man's care, and there was nothing to do but to take the prescribed
      treatment and await results as patiently as he could. Meanwhile there was
      no need to worry Billy, or William, or anybody else with the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy was so busy with her holiday plans that she was only vaguely aware
      of what seemed to be an increase of restlessness on the part of her
      husband during those days just before Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear, is the arm feeling horrid to-day?&rdquo; she asked one morning, when
      the gloom on her husband's face was deeper than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram frowned and did not answer directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots of good I am these days!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his moody eyes on the armful
      of many-shaped, many-sized packages she carried. &ldquo;What are those for-the
      tree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and it's going to be so pretty, Bertram,&rdquo; exulted Billy. &ldquo;And, do
      you know, Baby positively acts as if he suspected things&mdash;little as
      he is,&rdquo; she went on eagerly. &ldquo;He's as nervous as a witch. I can't keep him
      still a minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about his mother?&rdquo; hinted Bertram, with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm afraid she isn't exactly calm herself,&rdquo; she confessed, as she
      hurried out of the room with her parcels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram looked after her longingly, despondently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what she'd say if she&mdash;knew,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;But she sha'n't
      know&mdash;till she just has to,&rdquo; he vowed suddenly, under his breath,
      striding into the hall for his hat and coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had the Strata known such a Christmas as this was planned to be.
      Cyril, Marie, and the twins were to be there, also Kate, her husband and
      three children, Paul, Egbert, and little Kate, from the West. On Christmas
      Day there was to be a big family dinner, with Aunt Hannah down from the
      Annex. Then, in concession to the extreme youth of the young host and his
      twin cousins, there was to be an afternoon tree. The shades were to be
      drawn and the candles lighted, however, so that there might be no loss of
      effect. In the evening the tree was to be once more loaded with
      fascinating packages and candy-bags, and this time the Greggorys, Tommy
      Dunn, and all the rest from the Annex were to have the fun all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      From garret to basement the Strata was aflame with holly, and aglitter
      with tinsel. Nowhere did there seem to be a spot that did not have its bit
      of tissue paper or its trail of red ribbon. And everything&mdash;holly,
      ribbon, tissue, and tinsel&mdash;led to the mysteriously closed doors of
      the great front drawing-room, past which none but Billy and her accredited
      messengers might venture. No wonder, indeed, that even Baby scented
      excitement, and that Baby's mother was not exactly calm. No wonder, too,
      that Bertram, with his helpless right arm, and his heavy heart, felt
      peculiarly forlorn and &ldquo;out of it.&rdquo; No wonder, also, that he took himself
      literally out of it with growing frequency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Hartwell and little Kate were to stay at the Strata. The
      boys, Paul and Egbert, were to go to Cyril's. Promptly at the appointed
      time, two days before Christmas, they arrived. And from that hour until
      two days after Christmas, when the last bit of holly, ribbon, tissue, and
      tinsel disappeared from the floor, Billy moved in a whirl of anxious
      responsibility that was yet filled with fun, frolic, and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great success, the whole affair. Everybody seemed pleased and
      happy&mdash;that is, everybody but Bertram; and he very plainly tried to
      seem pleased and happy. Even Cyril unbent to the extent of not appearing
      to mind the noise one bit; and Sister Kate (Bertram said) found only the
      extraordinarily small number of four details to change in the
      arrangements. Baby obligingly let his teeth-getting go, for the occasion,
      and he and the twins, Franz and Felix, were the admiration and delight of
      all. Little Kate, to be sure, was a trifle disconcerting once or twice,
      but everybody was too absorbed to pay much attention to her. Billy did,
      however, remember her opening remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, little Kate, do you remember me?&rdquo; Billy had greeted her pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; little Kate had answered, with a winning smile. &ldquo;You're my Aunt
      Billy what married my Uncle Bertram instead of Uncle William as you said
      you would first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody laughed, and Billy colored, of course; but little Kate went on
      eagerly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I've been wanting just awfully to see you,&rdquo; she announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you? I'm glad, I'm sure. I feel highly flattered,&rdquo; smiled Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have. You see, I wanted to ask you something. Have you ever
      wished that you <i>had</i> married Uncle William instead of Uncle Bertram,
      or that you'd tried for Uncle Cyril before Aunty Marie got him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate!&rdquo; gasped her horrified mother. &ldquo;I told you&mdash;You see,&rdquo; she broke
      off, turning to Billy despairingly. &ldquo;She's been pestering me with
      questions like that ever since she knew she was coming. She never has
      forgotten the way you changed from one uncle to the other. You may
      remember; it made a great impression on her at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I remember,&rdquo; stammered Billy, trying to laugh off her
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't told me yet whether you did wish you'd married Uncle
      William, or Uncle Cyril,&rdquo; interposed little Kate, persistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, of course not!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, with a vivid blush, casting her
      eyes about for a door of escape, and rejoicing greatly when she spied
      Delia with the baby coming toward them. &ldquo;There, look, my dear, here's your
      new cousin, little Bertram!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Don't you want to see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Kate turned dutifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm, Aunt Billy, but I'd rather see the twins. Mother says <i>they're</i>
      real pretty and cunning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;y-yes, they are,&rdquo; murmured Billy, on whom the emphasis of the
      &ldquo;they're&rdquo; had not been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, as may be supposed, therefore, Billy had not forgotten little
      Kate's opening remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after Christmas Mr. Hartwell and the boys went back to their
      Western home, leaving Mrs. Hartwell and her daughter to make a round of
      visits to friends in the East. For almost a week after Christmas they
      remained at the Strata; and it was on the last day of their stay that
      little Kate asked the question that proved so momentous in results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, almost unconsciously, had avoided tête-á-têtes with her small
      guest. But to-day they were alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Billy,&rdquo; began the little girl, after a meditative gaze into the
      other's face, &ldquo;you <i>are</i> married to Uncle Bertram, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly am, my dear,&rdquo; smiled Billy, trying to speak unconcernedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, what makes you forget it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes me forget&mdash;Why, child, what a question! What do you mean?
      I don't forget it!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what <i>did</i> mother mean? I heard her tell Uncle William myself&mdash;she
      didn't know I heard, though&mdash;that she did wish you'd remember you
      were Uncle Bertram's wife as well as Cousin Bertram's mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy flushed scarlet, then grew very white. At that moment Mrs. Hartwell
      came into the room. Little Kate turned triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, she hasn't forgotten, and I knew she hadn't, mother! I asked her
      just now, and she said she hadn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn't what?&rdquo; questioned Mrs. Hartwell, looking a little apprehensively
      at her sister-in-law's white face and angry eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn't forgotten that she was Uncle Bertram's wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; interposed Billy, steadily meeting her sister-in-law's gaze, &ldquo;will
      you be good enough to tell me what this child is talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartwell sighed, and gave an impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate, I've a mind to take you home on the next train,&rdquo; she said to her
      daughter. &ldquo;Run away, now, down-stairs. Your Aunt Billy and I want to talk.
      Come, come, hurry! I mean what I say,&rdquo; she added warningly, as she saw
      unmistakable signs of rebellion on the small young face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; pouted little Kate, rising reluctantly, and moving toward the
      door, &ldquo;that you didn't always send me away just when I wanted most to
      stay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Kate?&rdquo; prompted Billy, as the door closed behind the little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose I'll have to say it now, as long as that child has put her
      finger in the pie. But I hadn't intended to speak, no matter what I saw. I
      promised myself I wouldn't, before I came. I know, of course, how Bertram
      and Cyril, and William, too, say that I'm always interfering in affairs
      that don't concern me&mdash;though, for that matter, if my own brother's
      affairs don't concern me, I don't know whose should!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, as I said, I wasn't going to speak this time, no matter what I saw.
      And I haven't&mdash;except to William, and Cyril, and Aunt Hannah; but I
      suppose somewhere little Kate got hold of it. It's simply this, Billy. It
      seems to me it's high time you began to realize that you're Bertram's wife
      as well as the baby's mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, I am&mdash;I don't think I quite understand,&rdquo; said Billy,
      unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose you don't,&rdquo; sighed Kate, &ldquo;though where your eyes are, I
      don't see&mdash;or, rather, I do see: they're on the baby, <i>always</i>.
      It's all very well and lovely, Billy, to be a devoted mother, and you
      certainly are that. I'll say that much for you, and I'll admit I never
      thought you would be. But <i>can't</i> you see what you're doing to
      Bertram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Doing to Bertram!</i>&mdash;by being a devoted mother to his son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, doing to Bertram. Can't you see what a change there is in the boy?
      He doesn't act like himself at all. He's restless and gloomy and entirely
      out of sorts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; but that's his arm,&rdquo; pleaded Billy. &ldquo;Poor boy&mdash;he's so
      tired of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate shook her head decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's more than his arm, Billy. You'd see it yourself if you weren't
      blinded by your absorption in that baby. Where is Bertram every evening?
      Where is he daytimes? Do you realize that he's been at home scarcely one
      evening since I came? And as for the days&mdash;he's almost never here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Kate, he can't paint now, you know, so of course he doesn't need to
      stay so closely at home,&rdquo; defended Billy. &ldquo;He goes out to find distraction
      from himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, 'distraction,' indeed,&rdquo; sniffed Kate. &ldquo;And where do you suppose he
      finds it? Do you <i>know</i> where he finds it? I tell you, Billy, Bertram
      Henshaw is not the sort of man that should find too much 'distraction'
      outside his home. His tastes and his temperament are altogether too
      Bohemian, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy interrupted with a peremptorily upraised hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please remember, Kate, you are speaking of my husband to his wife; and
      his wife has perfect confidence in him, and is just a little particular as
      to what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; well, I'm speaking of my brother, too, whom I know very well,&rdquo;
       shrugged Kate. &ldquo;All is, you may remember sometime that I warned you&mdash;that's
      all. This trusting business is all very pretty; but I think 'twould be a
      lot prettier, and a vast deal more sensible, if you'd give him a little
      attention as well as trust, and see if you can't keep him at home a bit
      more. At least you'll know whom he's with, then. Cyril says he saw him
      last week with Bob Seaver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With&mdash;Bob&mdash;Seaver?&rdquo; faltered Billy, changing color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I see you remember him,&rdquo; smiled Kate, not quite agreeably. &ldquo;Perhaps
      now you'll take some stock in what I've said, and remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll remember it, certainly,&rdquo; returned Billy, a little proudly. &ldquo;You've
      said a good many things to me, in the past, Mrs. Hartwell, and I've
      remembered them all&mdash;every one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Kate's turn to flush, and she did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. And I presume very likely sometimes there <i>hasn't</i> been
      much foundation for what I've said. I think this time, however, you'll
      find there is,&rdquo; she finished, with an air of hurt dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy made no reply, perhaps because Delia, at that moment, brought in the
      baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartwell and little Kate left the Strata the next morning. Until then
      Billy contrived to keep, before them, a countenance serene, and a manner
      free from unrest. Even when, after dinner that evening, Bertram put on his
      hat and coat and went out, Billy refused to meet her sister-in-law's
      meaning gaze. But in the morning, after they had left the house, Billy did
      not attempt to deceive herself. Determinedly, then, she set herself to
      going over in her mind the past months since the baby came; and she was
      appalled at what she found. Ever in her ears, too, was that feared name,
      &ldquo;Bob Seaver&rdquo;; and ever before her eyes was that night years ago when, as
      an eighteen-year-old girl, she had followed Bertram and Bob Seaver into a
      glittering café at eleven o'clock at night, because Bertram had been
      drinking and was not himself. She remembered Bertram's face when he had
      seen her, and what he had said when she begged him to come home. She
      remembered, too, what the family had said afterward. But she remembered,
      also, that years later Bertram had told her what that escapade of hers had
      really done for him, and that he believed he had actually loved her from
      that moment. After that night, at all events, he had had little to do with
      Bob Seaver.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Seaver was back again, it seemed&mdash;and with Bertram. They had
      been seen together. But if they had, what could she do? Surely she could
      hardly now follow them into a public café and demand that Seaver let her
      husband come home! But she could keep him at home, perhaps. (Billy quite
      brightened at this thought.) Kate had said that she was so absorbed in
      Baby that her husband received no attention at all. Billy did not believe
      this was true; but if it were true, she could at least rectify that
      mistake. If it were attention that he wanted&mdash;he should want no more.
      Poor Bertram! No wonder that he had sought distraction outside! When one
      had a horrid broken arm that would not let one do anything, what else
      could one do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Just here Billy suddenly remembered the book, &ldquo;A Talk to Young Wives.&rdquo; If
      she recollected rightly, there was a chapter that covered the very claim
      Kate had been making. Billy had not thought of the book for months, but
      she went at once to get it now. There might be, after all, something in it
      that would help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Coming of the First Baby.&rdquo; Billy found the chapter without difficulty
      and settled herself to read, her countenance alight with interest. In a
      surprisingly short time, however, a new expression came to her face; and
      at last a little gasp of dismay fell from her lips. She looked up then,
      with a startled gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Had</i> her walls possessed eyes and ears all these past months, only
      to give instructions to an unseen hand that it might write what the eyes
      and ears had learned? For it was such sentences as these that the
      conscience-smitten Billy read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maternity is apt to work a miracle in a woman's life, but sometimes it
      spells disaster so far as domestic bliss is concerned. The young mother,
      wrapped up in the delights and duties of motherhood, utterly forgets that
      she has a husband. She lives and moves and has her being in the nursery.
      She thinks baby, talks baby, knows only baby. She refuses to dress up,
      because it is easier to take care of baby in a frowzy wrapper. She will
      not go out with her husband for fear something might happen to the baby.
      She gives up her music because baby won't let her practice. In vain her
      husband tries to interest her in his own affairs. She has neither eyes nor
      ears for him, only for baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now no man enjoys having his nose put out of joint, even by his own
      child. He loves his child devotedly, and is proud of him, of course; but
      that does not keep him from wanting the society of his wife occasionally,
      nor from longing for her old-time love and sympathetic interest. It is an
      admirable thing, certainly, for a woman to be a devoted mother; but
      maternal affection can be carried too far. Husbands have some rights as
      well as offspring; and the wife who neglects her husband for her babies
      does so at her peril. Home, with the wife eternally in the nursery, is apt
      to be a dull and lonely thing to the average husband, so he starts out to
      find amusement for himself&mdash;and he finds it. Then is the time when
      the new little life that is so precious, and that should have bound the
      two more closely together, becomes the wedge that drives them apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy did not read any more. With a little sobbing cry she flung the book
      back into her desk, and began to pull off her wrapper. Her fingers shook.
      Already she saw herself a Monster, a Wicked Destroyer of Domestic Bliss
      with her thoughtless absorption in Baby, until he had become that Awful
      Thing&mdash;a <i>Wedge</i>. And Bertram&mdash;poor Bertram, with his
      broken arm! She had not played to him, nor sung to him, nor gone out with
      him. And when had they had one of their good long talks about Bertram's
      work and plans?
    </p>
    <p>
      But it should all be changed now. She would play, and sing, and go out
      with him. She would dress up, too. He should see no more wrappers. She
      would ask about his work, and seem interested. She <i>was</i> interested.
      She remembered now, that just before he was hurt, he had told her of a new
      portrait, and of a new &ldquo;Face of a Girl&rdquo; that he had planned to do. Lately
      he had said nothing about these. He had seemed discouraged&mdash;and no
      wonder, with his broken arm! But she would change all that. He should see!
      And forthwith Billy hurried to her closet to pick out her prettiest house
      frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before dinner Billy was ready, waiting in the drawing-room. She had
      on a pretty little blue silk gown that she knew Bertram liked, and she
      watched very anxiously for Bertram to come up the steps. She remembered
      now, with a pang, that he had long since given up his peculiar ring; but
      she meant to meet him at the door just the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram, however, did not come. At a quarter before six he telephoned that
      he had met some friends, and would dine at the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, my, how pretty we are!&rdquo; exclaimed Uncle William, when they went down
      to dinner together. &ldquo;New frock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, Uncle William,&rdquo; laughed Billy, a little tremulously. &ldquo;You've
      seen it dozens of times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I?&rdquo; murmured the man. &ldquo;I don't seem to remember it. Too bad Bertram
      isn't here to see you. Somehow, you look unusually pretty to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Billy's heart ached anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy spent the evening practicing&mdash;softly, to be sure, so as not to
      wake Baby&mdash;but <i>practicing</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the days passed Billy discovered that it was much easier to say she
      would &ldquo;change things&rdquo; than it was really to change them. She changed
      herself, it is true&mdash;her clothes, her habits, her words, and her
      thoughts; but it was more difficult to change Bertram. In the first place,
      he was there so little. She was dismayed when she saw how very little,
      indeed, he was at home&mdash;and she did not like to ask him outright to
      stay. That was not in accordance with her plans. Besides, the &ldquo;Talk to
      Young Wives&rdquo; said that indirect influence was much to be preferred,
      always, to direct persuasion&mdash;which last, indeed, usually failed to
      produce results.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Billy &ldquo;dressed up,&rdquo; and practiced, and talked (of anything but the
      baby), and even hinted shamelessly once or twice that she would like to go
      to the theater; but all to little avail. True, Bertram brightened up, for
      a minute, when he came home and found her in a new or a favorite dress,
      and he told her how pretty she looked. He appeared to like to have her
      play to him, too, even declaring once or twice that it was quite like old
      times, yes, it was. But he never noticed her hints about the theater, and
      he did not seem to like to talk about his work, even a little bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy laid this last fact to his injured arm. She decided that he had
      become blue and discouraged, and that he needed cheering up, especially
      about his work; so she determinedly and systematically set herself to
      doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She talked of the fine work he had done, and of the still finer work he
      would yet do, when his arm was well. She told him how proud she was of
      him, and she let him see how dear his Art was to her, and how badly she
      would feel if she thought he had really lost all his interest in his work
      and would never paint again. She questioned him about the new portrait he
      was to begin as soon as his arm would let him; and she tried to arouse his
      enthusiasm in the picture he had planned to show in the March Exhibition
      of the Bohemian Ten, telling him that she was sure his arm would allow him
      to complete at least one canvas to hang.
    </p>
    <p>
      In none of this, however, did Bertram appear in the least interested. The
      one thing, indeed, which he seemed not to want to talk about, was his
      work; and he responded to her overtures on the subject with only moody
      silence, or else with almost irritable monosyllables; all of which not
      only grieved but surprised Billy very much. For, according to the &ldquo;Talk to
      Young Wives,&rdquo; she was doing exactly what the ideal, sympathetic,
      interested-in-her-husband's-work wife should do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When February came, bringing with it no change for the better, Billy was
      thoroughly frightened. Bertram's arm plainly was not improving. He was
      more gloomy and restless than ever. He seemed not to want to stay at home
      at all; and Billy knew now for a certainty that he was spending more and
      more time with Bob Seaver and &ldquo;the boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Billy! Nowhere could she look these days and see happiness. Even the
      adored baby seemed, at times, almost to give an added pang. Had he not
      become, according to the &ldquo;Talk to Young Wives&rdquo; that awful thing, a <i>Wedge</i>?
      The Annex, too, carried its sting; for where was the need of an overflow
      house for happiness now, when there was no happiness to overflow? Even the
      little jade idol on Billy's mantel Billy could not bear to see these days,
      for its once bland smile had become a hideous grin, demanding, &ldquo;Where,
      now, is your heap plenty velly good luckee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, before Bertram, Billy still carried a bravely smiling face, and to
      him still she talked earnestly and enthusiastically of his work&mdash;which
      last, as it happened, was the worst course she could have pursued; for the
      one thing poor Bertram wished to forget, just now, was&mdash;his work.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. CONSPIRATORS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early in February came Arkwright's appearance at the Boston Opera House&mdash;the
      first since he had sung there as a student a few years before. He was an
      immediate and an unquestioned success. His portrait adorned the front page
      of almost every Boston newspaper the next morning, and captious critics
      vied with each other to do him honor. His full history, from boyhood up,
      was featured, with special emphasis on his recent triumphs in New York and
      foreign capitals. He was interviewed as to his opinion on everything from
      vegetarianism to woman's suffrage; and his preferences as to pies and
      pastimes were given headline prominence. There was no doubt of it. Mr. M.
      J. Arkwright was a star.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Arkwright's old friends, including Billy, Bertram, Cyril, Marie,
      Calderwell, Alice Greggory, Aunt Hannah, and Tommy Dunn, went to hear him
      sing; and after the performance he held a miniature reception, with enough
      adulation to turn his head completely around, he declared deprecatingly.
      Not until the next evening, however, did he have an opportunity for what
      he called a real talk with any of his friends; then, in Calderwell's room,
      he settled back in his chair with a sigh of content.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time his own and Calderwell's affairs occupied their attention;
      then, after a short pause, the tenor asked abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything&mdash;wrong with the Henshaws, Calderwell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell came suddenly erect in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you! I hoped you'd introduce that subject; though, for that matter,
      if you hadn't, I should. Yes, there is&mdash;and I'm looking to you, old
      man, to get them out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; Arkwright sat erect now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way, the expected has happened&mdash;though I know now that I didn't
      really expect it to happen, in spite of my prophecies. You may remember I
      was always skeptical on the subject of Bertram's settling down to a
      domestic hearthstone. I insisted 'twould be the turn of a girl's head and
      the curve of her cheek that he wanted to paint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright looked up with a quick frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean that Henshaw has been cad enough to find another&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell threw up his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not that! We haven't that to deal with&mdash;yet, thank goodness!
      There's no woman in it. And, really, when you come right down to it, if
      ever a fellow had an excuse to seek diversion, Bertram Henshaw has&mdash;poor
      chap! It's just this. Bertram broke his arm again last October.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so I hear, and I thought he was looking badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is. It's a bad business. 'Twas improperly set in the first place, and
      it's not doing well now. In fact, I'm told on pretty good authority that
      the doctor says he probably will never use it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by George! Calderwell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Tough, isn't it? 'Specially when you think of his work, and know&mdash;as
      I happen to&mdash;that he's particularly dependent on his right hand for
      everything. He doesn't tell this generally, and I understand Billy and the
      family know nothing of it&mdash;how hopeless the case is, I mean. Well,
      naturally, the poor fellow has been pretty thoroughly discouraged, and to
      get away from himself he's gone back to his old Bohemian habits, spending
      much of his time with some of his old cronies that are none too good for
      him&mdash;Seaver, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob Seaver? Yes, I know him.&rdquo; Arkwright's lips snapped together crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He said he knew you. That's why I'm counting on your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean I want you to get Henshaw away from him, and keep him away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright's face darkened with an angry flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott, Calderwell! What are you talking about? Henshaw is no kid to
      be toted home, and I'm no nursery governess to do the toting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calderwell laughed quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don't think any one would take you for a nursery governess,
      Arkwright, in spite of the fact that you are still known to some of your
      friends as 'Mary Jane.' But you can sing a song, man, which will promptly
      give you a through ticket to their innermost sacred circle. In fact, to my
      certain knowledge, Seaver is already planning a jamboree with you at the
      right hand of the toastmaster. There's your chance. Once in, stay in&mdash;long
      enough to get Henshaw out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, good heavens, Calderwell, it's impossible! What can I do?&rdquo; demanded
      Arkwright, savagely. &ldquo;I can't walk up to the man, take him by the ear, and
      say: 'Here, you, sir&mdash;march home!' Neither can I come the
      'I-am-holier-than-thou' act, and hold up to him the mirror of his
      transgressions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you can get him out of it <i>some</i> way. You can find a way&mdash;for
      Billy's sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer, and, after a moment, Calderwell went on more quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't seen Billy but two or three times since I came back to Boston&mdash;but
      I don't need to, to know that she's breaking her heart over something. And
      of course that something is&mdash;Bertram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was still no answer. Arkwright got up suddenly, and walked to the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I'm helpless,&rdquo; resumed Calderwell. &ldquo;I don't paint pictures, nor
      sing songs, nor write stories, nor dance jigs for a living&mdash;and you
      have to do one or another to be in with that set. And it's got to be a
      Johnny-on-the-spot with Bertram. All is, something will have to be done to
      get him out of the state of mind and body he's in now, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright wheeled sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you say this jamboree was going to be?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next week, some time. The date is not settled. They were going to consult
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm-m,&rdquo; commented Arkwright. And, though his next remark was a complete
      change of subject, Calderwell gave a contented sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, when the proposition was first made to him, Arkwright was doubtful of
      his ability to be a successful &ldquo;Johnny-on-the-spot,&rdquo; he was even more
      doubtful of it as the days passed, and he was attempting to carry out the
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had known that he was undertaking a most difficult and delicate task,
      and he soon began to fear that it was an impossible one, as well. With a
      dogged persistence, however, he adhered to his purpose, ever on the alert
      to be more watchful, more tactful, more efficient in emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disagreeable as was the task, in a way, in another way it was a great
      pleasure to him. He was glad of the opportunity to do anything for Billy;
      and then, too, he was glad of something absorbing enough to take his mind
      off his own affairs. He told himself, sometimes, that this helping another
      man to fight his tiger skin was assisting himself to fight his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright was trying very hard not to think of Alice Greggory these days.
      He had come back hoping that he was in a measure &ldquo;cured&rdquo; of his &ldquo;folly,&rdquo;
       as he termed it; but the first look into Alice Greggory's blue-gray eyes
      had taught him the fallacy of that idea. In that very first meeting with
      Alice, he feared that he had revealed his secret, for she was plainly so
      nervously distant and ill at ease with him that he could but construe her
      embarrassment and chilly dignity as pity for him and a desire to show him
      that she had nothing but friendship for him. Since then he had seen but
      little of her, partly because he did not wish to see her, and partly
      because his time was so fully occupied. Then, too, in a round-about way he
      had heard a rumor that Calderwell was engaged to be married; and, though
      no feminine name had been mentioned in connection with the story,
      Arkwright had not hesitated to supply in his own mind that of Alice
      Greggory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginning with the &ldquo;jamboree,&rdquo; which came off quite in accordance with
      Calderwell's prophecies, Arkwright spent the most of such time as was not
      given to his professional duties in deliberately cultivating the society
      of Bertram and his friends. To this extent he met with no difficulty, for
      he found that M. J. Arkwright, the new star in the operatic firmament, was
      obviously a welcome comrade. Beyond this it was not so easy. Arkwright
      wondered, indeed, sometimes, if he were making any progress at all. But
      still he persevered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked with Bertram, he talked with Bertram, unobtrusively he contrived
      to be near Bertram almost always, when they were together with &ldquo;the boys.&rdquo;
       Gradually he won from him the story of what the surgeon had said to him,
      and of how black the future looked in consequence. This established a new
      bond between them, so potent that Arkwright ventured to test it one day by
      telling Bertram the story of the tiger skin&mdash;the first tiger skin in
      his uncle's library years ago, and of how, since then, any difficulty he
      had encountered he had tried to treat as a tiger skin. In telling the
      story he was careful to draw no moral for his listener, and to preach no
      sermon. He told the tale, too, with all possible whimsical lightness of
      touch, and immediately at its conclusion he changed the subject. But that
      he had not failed utterly in his design was evidenced a few days later
      when Bertram grimly declared that he guessed <i>his</i> tiger skin was a
      lively beast, all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time Arkwright went home with Bertram, his presence was almost a
      necessity. Bertram was not quite himself that night. Billy admitted them.
      She had plainly been watching and waiting. Arkwright never forgot the look
      on her face as her eyes met his. There was a curious mixture of terror,
      hurt pride, relief, and shame, overtopped by a fierce loyalty which almost
      seemed to say aloud the words: &ldquo;Don't you dare to blame him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright's heart ached with sympathy and admiration at the proudly
      courageous way in which Billy carried off the next few painful minutes.
      Even when he bade her good night a little later, only her eyes said &ldquo;thank
      you.&rdquo; Her lips were dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright often went home with Bertram after that. Not that it was always
      necessary&mdash;far from it. Some time, indeed, elapsed before he had
      quite the same excuse again for his presence. But he had found that
      occasionally he could get Bertram home earlier by adroit suggestions of
      one kind or another; and more and more frequently he was succeeding in
      getting him home for a game of chess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram liked chess, and was a fine player. Since breaking his arm he had
      turned to games with the feverish eagerness of one who looks for something
      absorbing to fill an unrestful mind. It was Seaver's skill in chess that
      had at first attracted Bertram to the man long ago; but Bertram could beat
      him easily&mdash;too easily for much pleasure in it now. So they did not
      play chess often these days. Bertram had found that, in spite of his
      injury, he could still take part in other games, and some of them, if not
      so intricate as chess, were at least more apt to take his mind off
      himself, especially if there were a bit of money up to add zest and
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it happened, however, Bertram learned one day that Arkwright could play
      chess&mdash;and play well, too, as he discovered after their first game
      together. This fact contributed not a little to such success as Arkwright
      was having in his efforts to wean Bertram from his undesirable companions;
      for Bertram soon found out that Arkwright was more than a match for
      himself, and the occasional games he did succeed in winning only whetted
      his appetite for more. Many an evening now, therefore, was spent by the
      two men in Bertram's den, with Billy anxiously hovering near, her eyes
      longingly watching either her husband's absorbed face or the pretty little
      red and white ivory figures, which seemed to possess so wonderful a power
      to hold his attention. In spite of her joy at the chessmen's efficacy in
      keeping Bertram at home, however, she was almost jealous of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arkwright, couldn't you show <i>me</i> how to play, sometime?&rdquo; she
      said wistfully, one evening, when the momentary absence of Bertram had
      left the two alone together. &ldquo;I used to watch Bertram and Marie play years
      ago; but I never knew how to play myself. Not that I can see where the fun
      is in just sitting staring at a chessboard for half an hour at a time,
      though! But Bertram likes it, and so I&mdash;I want to learn to stare with
      him. Will you teach me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad to,&rdquo; smiled Arkwright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then will you come, maybe, sometimes when Bertram is at the doctor's? He
      goes every Tuesday and Friday at three o'clock for treatment. I'd rather
      you came then for two reasons: first, because I don't want Bertram to know
      I'm learning, till I can play <i>some</i>; and, secondly, because&mdash;because
      I don't want to take you away&mdash;from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words were spoken very low, and were accompanied by a painful
      blush. It was the first time Billy had ever hinted to Arkwright, in words,
      that she understood what he was trying to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come next Tuesday,&rdquo; promised Arkwright, with a cheerfully
      unobservant air. Then Bertram came in, bringing the book of Chess
      Problems, for which he had gone up-stairs.

      CHAPTER XXIX. CHESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Promptly at three o'clock Tuesday afternoon Arkwright appeared at the
      Strata, and for the next hour Billy did her best to learn the names and
      the moves of the pretty little ivory men. But at the end of the hour she
      was almost ready to give up in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there weren't so many kinds, and if they didn't all insist on doing
      something different, it wouldn't be so bad,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;But how can you
      be expected to remember which goes diagonal, and which crisscross, and
      which can't go but one square, and which can skip 'way across the board,
      'specially when that little pawn-thing can go straight ahead <i>two</i>
      squares sometimes, and the next minute only one (except when it takes
      things, and then it goes crooked one square) and when that tiresome little
      horse tries to go all ways at once, and can jump 'round and hurdle over <i>anybody's</i>
      head, even the king's&mdash;how can you expect folks to remember? But,
      then, Bertram remembers,&rdquo; she added, resolutely, &ldquo;so I guess I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whenever possible, after that, Arkwright came on Tuesdays and Fridays,
      and, in spite of her doubts, Billy did very soon begin to &ldquo;remember.&rdquo;
       Spurred by her great desire to play with Bertram and surprise him, Billy
      spared no pains to learn well her lessons. Even among the baby's books and
      playthings these days might be found a &ldquo;Manual of Chess,&rdquo; for Billy
      pursued her study at all hours; and some nights even her dreams were of
      ruined, castles where kings and queens and bishops disported themselves,
      with pawns for servants, and where a weird knight on horseback used the
      castle's highest tower for a hurdle, landing always a hundred yards to one
      side of where he would be expected to come down.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long, of course, before Billy could play a game of chess, after
      a fashion, but she knew just enough to realize that she actually knew
      nothing; and she knew, too, that until she could play a really good game,
      her moves would not hold Bertram's attention for one minute. Not at
      present, therefore, was she willing Bertram should know what she was
      attempting to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy had not yet learned what the great surgeon had said to Bertram. She
      knew only that his arm was no better, and that he never voluntarily spoke
      of his painting. Over her now seemed to be hanging a vague horror.
      Something was the matter. She knew that. But what it was she could not
      fathom. She realized that Arkwright was trying to help, and her gratitude,
      though silent, knew no bounds. Not even to Aunt Hannah or Uncle William
      could she speak of this thing that was troubling her. That they, too,
      understood, in a measure, she realized. But still she said no word. Billy
      was wearing a proud little air of aloofness these days that was
      heart-breaking to those who saw it and read it aright for what it was:
      loyalty to Bertram, no matter what happened. And so Billy pored over her
      chessboard feverishly, tirelessly, having ever before her longing eyes the
      dear time when Bertram, across the table from her, should sit happily
      staring for half an hour at a move she had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Billy's chess-playing was to signify, however, in her own life,
      it was destined to play a part in the lives of two friends of hers that
      was most unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      During Billy's very first lesson, as it chanced, Alice Greggory called and
      found Billy and Arkwright so absorbed in their game that they did not at
      first hear Eliza speak her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quick color that flew to Arkwright's face at sight of herself was
      construed at once by Alice as embarrassment on his part at being found
      tête-á-tête with Bertram Henshaw's wife. And she did not like it. She was
      not pleased that he was there. She was less pleased that he blushed for
      being there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that Alice found him there again several times. Alice gave
      a piano lesson at two o'clock every Tuesday and Friday afternoon to a
      little Beacon Street neighbor of Billy's, and she had fallen into the
      habit of stepping in to see Billy for a few minutes afterward, which
      brought her there at a little past three, just after the chess lesson was
      well started.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, the first time that Alice Greggory found Arkwright opposite Billy at
      the chess-table, she was surprised and displeased, the second and third
      times she was much more so. When it finally came to her one day with
      sickening illumination, that always the tête-á-têtes were during Bertram's
      hour at the doctor's, she was appalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could it mean? Had Arkwright given up his fight? Was he playing false
      to himself and to Bertram by trying thus, on the sly, to win the love of
      his friend's wife? Was this man, whom she had so admired for his brave
      stand, and to whom all unasked she had given her heart's best love (more
      the pity of it!)&mdash;was this idol of hers to show feet of clay, after
      all? She could not believe it. And yet&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sick at heart, but imbued with the determination of a righteous cause,
      Alice Greggory resolved, for Billy's sake, to watch and wait. If necessary
      she should speak to some one&mdash;though to whom she did not know.
      Billy's happiness should not be put in jeopardy if she could help it.
      Indeed, no!
    </p>
    <p>
      As the weeks passed, Alice came to be more and more uneasy, distressed,
      and grieved. Of Billy she could believe no evil; but of Arkwright she was
      beginning to think she could believe everything that was dishonorable and
      despicable. And to believe that of the man she still loved&mdash;no wonder
      that Alice did not look nor act like herself these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incensed at herself because she did love him, angry at him because he
      seemed to be proving himself so unworthy of that love, and genuinely
      frightened at what she thought was the fast-approaching wreck of all
      happiness for her dear friend, Billy, Alice did not know which way to
      turn. At the first she had told herself confidently that she would &ldquo;speak
      to somebody.&rdquo; But, as time passed, she saw the impracticability of that
      idea. Speak to somebody, indeed! To whom? When? Where? What should she
      say? Where was her right to say anything? She was not dealing with a
      parcel of naughty children who had pilfered the cake jar! She was dealing
      with grown men and women, who, presumedly, knew their own affairs, and
      who, certainly, would resent any interference from her. On the other hand,
      could she stand calmly by and see Bertram lose his wife, Arkwright his
      honor, Billy her happiness, and herself her faith in human nature, all
      because to do otherwise would be to meddle in other people's business?
      Apparently she could, and should. At least that seemed to be the rôle
      which she was expected to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when Alice had reached this unhappy frame of mind that Arkwright
      himself unexpectedly opened the door for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two were alone together in Bertram Henshaw's den. It was Tuesday
      afternoon. Alice had called to find Billy and Arkwright deep in their
      usual game of chess. Then a matter of domestic affairs had taken Billy
      from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I'll have to be gone ten minutes, or more,&rdquo; she had said, as
      she rose from the table reluctantly. &ldquo;But you might be showing Alice the
      moves, Mr. Arkwright,&rdquo; she had added, with a laugh, as she disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I teach you the moves?&rdquo; he had smiled, when they were alone
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice's reply had been so indignantly short and sharp that Arkwright,
      after a moment's pause, had said, with a whimsical smile that yet carried
      a touch of sadness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am forced to surmise from your answer that you think it is <i>you</i>
      who should be teaching <i>me</i> moves. At all events, I seem to have been
      making some moves lately that have not suited you, judging by your
      actions. Have I offended you in any way, Alice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned with a quick lifting of her head. Alice knew that if ever
      she were to speak, it must be now. Never again could she hope for such an
      opportunity as this. Suddenly throwing circumspect caution quite aside,
      she determined that she would speak. Springing to her feet she crossed the
      room and seated herself in Billy's chair at the chess-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! Offend me!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in a low voice. &ldquo;As if I were the one you
      were offending!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, <i>Alice!</i>&rdquo; murmured the man, in obvious stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice raised her hand, palm outward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't, <i>please</i> don't pretend you don't know,&rdquo; she begged,
      almost piteously. &ldquo;Please don't add that to all the rest. Oh, I
      understand, of course, it's none of my affairs, and I wasn't going to
      speak,&rdquo; she choked; &ldquo;but, to-day, when you gave me this chance, I had to.
      At first I couldn't believe it,&rdquo; she plunged on, plainly hurrying against
      Billy's return. &ldquo;After all you'd told me of how you meant to fight it&mdash;your
      tiger skin. And I thought it merely <i>happened</i> that you were here
      alone with her those days I came. Then, when I found out they were <i>always</i>
      the days Mr. Henshaw was away at the doctor's, I had to believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped for breath. Arkwright, who, up to this moment had shown that
      he was completely mystified as to what she was talking about, suddenly
      flushed a painful red. He was obviously about to speak, but she prevented
      him with a quick gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a little more I've got to say, please. As if it weren't bad
      enough to do what you're doing <i>at all</i>, but you must needs take it
      at such a time as this when&mdash;when her husband <i>isn't</i> doing just
      what he ought to do, and we all know it&mdash;it's so unfair to take her
      now, and try to&mdash;to win&mdash;And you aren't even fair with him,&rdquo; she
      protested tremulously. &ldquo;You pretend to be his friend. You go with him
      everywhere. It's just as if you were <i>helping</i> to&mdash;to pull him
      down. You're one with the whole bunch.&rdquo; (The blood suddenly receded from
      Arkwright's face, leaving it very white; but if Alice saw it, she paid no
      heed.) &ldquo;Everybody says you are. Then to come here like this, on the sly,
      when you know he can't be here, I&mdash;Oh, can't you see what you're
      doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's pause, then Arkwright spoke. A deep pain looked from
      his eyes. He was still very pale, and his mouth had settled into sad
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, perhaps, it may be just as well if I tell you what I <i>am</i>
      doing&mdash;or, rather, trying to do,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you see,&rdquo; he added, when he had finished the tale, &ldquo;I haven't
      really accomplished much, after all, and it seems the little I have
      accomplished has only led to my being misjudged by you, my best friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alice gave a sobbing cry. Her face was scarlet. Horror, shame, and relief
      struggled for mastery in her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I didn't know, I didn't know,&rdquo; she moaned, twisting her hands
      nervously. &ldquo;And now, when you've been so brave, so true&mdash;for me to
      accuse you of&mdash;Oh, can you <i>ever</i> forgive me? But you see,
      knowing that you <i>did</i> care for her, it did look&mdash;&rdquo; She choked
      into silence, and turned away her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her tenderly, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, after a minute, in a low voice. &ldquo;I can see how it did
      look; and so I'm going to tell you now something I had meant never to tell
      you. There really couldn't have been anything in that, you see, for I
      found out long ago that it was gone&mdash;whatever love there had been for&mdash;Billy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your&mdash;tiger skin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I thought it was alive,&rdquo; smiled Arkwright, sadly, &ldquo;when I asked
      you to help me fight it. But one day, very suddenly, I discovered that it
      was nothing but a dead skin of dreams and memories. But I made another
      discovery, too. I found that just beyond lay another one, and that was
      very much alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another one?&rdquo; Alice turned to him in wonder. &ldquo;But you never asked me to
      help you fight&mdash;that one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I couldn't, you see. You couldn't have helped me. You'd only have
      hindered me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hindered you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You see, it was my love for&mdash;you, that I was fighting&mdash;then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alice gave a low cry and flushed vividly; but Arkwright hurried on, his
      eyes turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I understand. I know. I'm not asking for&mdash;anything. I heard some
      time ago of your engagement to Calderwell. I've tried many times to say
      the proper, expected pretty speeches, but&mdash;I couldn't. I will now,
      though. I do. You have all my tenderest best wishes for your happiness&mdash;dear.
      If long ago I hadn't been such a blind fool as not to know my own heart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but there's some mistake,&rdquo; interposed Alice, palpitatingly,
      with hanging head. &ldquo;I&mdash;I'm not engaged to Mr. Calderwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright turned and sent a keen glance into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're&mdash;not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I heard that Calderwell&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard that Mr. Calderwell was engaged, very likely. But&mdash;it so
      happens he isn't engaged&mdash;to me,&rdquo; murmured Alice, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, long ago you said&mdash;&rdquo; Arkwright paused, his eyes still keenly
      searching her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what I said&mdash;long ago,&rdquo; laughed Alice, trying
      unsuccessfully to meet his gaze. &ldquo;One says lots of things, at times, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Into Arkwright's eyes came a new light, a light that plainly needed but a
      breath to fan it into quick fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;do you mean that maybe now&mdash;I needn't try
      to fight&mdash;that other tiger skin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkwright reached out a pleading hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice, dear, I've loved you so long,&rdquo; he begged unsteadily. &ldquo;Don't you
      think that sometime, if I was very, very patient, you could just <i>begin</i>&mdash;to
      care a little for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still there was no answer. Then, slowly, Alice shook her head. Her face
      was turned quite away&mdash;which was a pity, for if Arkwright could have
      seen the sudden tender mischief in her eyes, his own would not have become
      so somber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even a little bit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't ever&mdash;begin,&rdquo; answered a half-smothered voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice!&rdquo; cried the man, heart-brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice turned now, and for a fleeting instant let him see her eyes, glowing
      with the love so long kept in relentless exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't, because, you see-I began&mdash;long ago,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice!&rdquo; It was the same single word, but spoken with a world of
      difference, for into it now was crowded all the glory and the wonder of a
      great love. &ldquo;Alice!&rdquo; breathed the man again; and this time the word was,
      oh, so tenderly whispered into the little pink and white ear of the girl
      in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got delayed,&rdquo; began Billy, in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h!&rdquo; she broke off, beating a hushed, but precipitate, retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fully thirty minutes later, Billy came to the door again. This time her
      approach was heralded by a snatch of song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you'll excuse my being gone so long,&rdquo; she smiled, as she entered
      the room where her two guests sat decorously face to face at the
      chess-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know you said you'd be gone ten minutes,&rdquo; Arkwright reminded
      her, politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know I did.&rdquo; And Billy, to her credit, did not even smile at the
      man who did not know ten minutes from fifty.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. BY A BABY'S HAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      After all, it was the baby's hand that did it, as was proper, and perhaps
      to be expected; for surely, was it not Bertram, Jr.'s place to show his
      parents that he was, indeed, no Wedge, but a dear and precious Tie binding
      two loving, loyal hearts more and more closely together? It would seem,
      indeed, that Bertram, Jr., thought so, perhaps, and very bravely he set
      about it; though, to carry out his purpose, he had to turn his steps into
      an unfamiliar way&mdash;a way of pain, and weariness, and danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Arkwright who told Bertram that the baby was very sick, and that
      Billy wanted him. Bertram went home at once to find a distracted,
      white-faced Billy, and a twisted, pain-racked little creature, who it was
      almost impossible to believe was the happy, laughing baby boy he had left
      that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next two weeks nothing was thought of in the silent old Beacon
      Street house but the tiny little life hovering so near Death's door that
      twice it appeared to have slipped quite across the threshold. All through
      those terrible weeks it seemed as if Billy neither ate nor slept; and
      always at her side, comforting, cheering, and helping wherever possible
      was Bertram, tender, loving, and marvelously thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the turning point when the universe itself appeared to hang upon
      a baby's breath. Gradually, almost imperceptibly, came the fluttering back
      of the tiny spirit into the longing arms stretched so far, far out to meet
      and hold it. And the father and the mother, looking into each other's
      sleepless, dark-ringed eyes, knew that their son was once more theirs to
      love and cherish.
    </p>
    <p>
      When two have gone together with a dear one down into the Valley of the
      Shadow of Death, and have come back, either mourning or rejoicing, they
      find a different world from the one they had left. Things that were great
      before seem small, and some things that were small seem great. At least
      Bertram and Billy found their world thus changed when together they came
      back bringing their son with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the long weeks of convalescence, when the healthy rosiness stole bit by
      bit into the baby's waxen face, and the light of recognition and
      understanding crept day by day into the baby's eyes, there was many a
      quiet hour for heart-to-heart talks between the two who so anxiously and
      joyously hailed every rosy tint and fleeting sparkle. And there was so
      much to tell, so much to hear, so much to talk about! And always, running
      through everything, was that golden thread of joy, beside which all else
      paled&mdash;that they had Baby and each other. As if anything else
      mattered!
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, there was Bertram's arm. Very early in their talks Billy found
      out about that. But Billy, with Baby getting well, was not to be daunted,
      even by this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, darling&mdash;not paint again, indeed! Why, Bertram, of course
      you will,&rdquo; she cried confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Billy, the doctor said,&rdquo; began Bertram; but Billy would not even
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, what if he did, dear?&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;What if he did say
      you couldn't use your right arm much again?&rdquo; Billy's voice broke a little,
      then quickly steadied into something very much like triumph. &ldquo;You've got
      your left one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't paint with that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can,&rdquo; insisted Billy, firmly. &ldquo;Why, Bertram, what do you suppose
      you were given two arms for if not to fight with both of them? And I'm
      going to be ever so much prouder of what you paint now, because I'll know
      how splendidly you worked to do it. Besides, there's Baby. As if you
      weren't ever going to paint for Baby! Why, Bertram, I'm going to have you
      paint Baby, one of these days. Think how pleased he'll be to see it when
      he grows up! He's nicer, anyhow, than any old 'Face of a Girl' you ever
      did. Paint? Why, Bertram, darling, of course you're going to paint, and
      better than you ever did before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram shook his head again; but this time he smiled, and patted Billy's
      cheek with the tip of his forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I could!&rdquo; he disclaimed. But that afternoon he went into his
      long-deserted studio and hunted up his last unfinished picture. For some
      time he stood motionless before it; then, with a quick gesture of
      determination, he got out his palette, paints, and brushes. This time not
      until he had painted ten, a dozen, a score of strokes, did he drop his
      brush with a sigh and carefully erase the fresh paint on the canvas. The
      next day he worked longer, and this time he allowed a little, a very
      little, of what he had done to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third day Billy herself found him at his easel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;do you suppose I could?&rdquo; he asked fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dearest, of course you can! Haven't you noticed? Can't you see how
      much more you can do with your left hand now? You've <i>had</i> to use it,
      you see. <i>I've</i> seen you do a lot of things with it, lately, that you
      never used to do at all. And, of course, the more you do with it, the more
      you can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; but that doesn't mean that I can paint with it,&rdquo; sighed Bertram,
      ruefully eyeing the tiny bit of fresh color his canvas showed for his long
      afternoon's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait and see,&rdquo; nodded Billy, with so overwhelming a cheery confidence
      that Bertram, looking into her glowing face, was conscious of a curious
      throb of exultation, almost as if already the victory were his.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not always of Bertram's broken arm, nor even of his work that
      they talked. Bertram, hanging over the baby's crib to assure himself that
      the rosiness and the sparkle were really growing more apparent every day,
      used to wonder sometimes how ever in the world he could have been jealous
      of his son. He said as much one day to Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Billy it was a most astounding idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you were actually jealous of your own baby?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Why,
      Bertram, how could&mdash;And was that why you&mdash;you sought distraction
      and&mdash;Oh, but, Bertram, that was all my f-fault,&rdquo; she quavered
      remorsefully. &ldquo;I wouldn't play, nor sing, nor go to walk, nor anything;
      and I wore horrid frowzy wrappers all the time, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, come, Billy,&rdquo; expostulated the man. &ldquo;I'm not going to have you
      talk like that about <i>my wife!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did&mdash;the book said I did,&rdquo; wailed Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The book? Good heavens! Are there any books in this, too?&rdquo; demanded
      Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the same one; the&mdash;the 'Talks to Young Wives,'&rdquo; nodded Billy.
      And then, because some things had grown small to them, and some others
      great, they both laughed happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even this was not quite all; for one evening, very shyly, Billy
      brought out the chessboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I can't play well,&rdquo; she faltered; &ldquo;and maybe you don't want to
      play with me at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Bertram, when he found out why she had learned, was very sure he did
      want very much to play with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy did not beat, of course. But she did several times experience&mdash;for
      a few blissful minutes&mdash;the pleasure of seeing Bertram sit
      motionless, studying the board, because of a move she had made. And
      though, in the end, her king was ignominiously trapped with not an
      unguarded square upon which to set his poor distracted foot, the memory of
      those blissful minutes when she had made Bertram &ldquo;stare&rdquo; more than paid
      for the final checkmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the middle of June the baby was well enough to be taken to the beach,
      and Bertram was so fortunate as to secure the same house they had occupied
      before. Once again William went down in Maine for his fishing trip, and
      the Strata was closed. In the beach house Bertram was painting
      industriously&mdash;with his left hand. Almost he was beginning to feel
      Billy's enthusiasm. Almost he was believing that he <i>was</i> doing good
      work. It was not the &ldquo;Face of a Girl,&rdquo; now. It was the face of a baby:
      smiling, laughing, even crying, sometimes; at other times just gazing
      straight into your eyes with adorable soberness. Bertram still went into
      Boston twice a week for treatment, though the treatment itself had
      changed. The great surgeon had sent him to still another specialist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a chance&mdash;though perhaps a small one,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;I'd
      like you to try it, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the summer advanced, Bertram thought sometimes that he could see a
      slight improvement in his injured arm; but he tried not to think too much
      about this. He had thought the same thing before, only to be disappointed
      in the end. Besides, he was undeniably interested just now in seeing if he
      <i>could</i> paint with his left hand. Billy was so sure, and she had said
      that she would be prouder than ever of him, if he could&mdash;and he would
      like to make Billy proud! Then, too, there was the baby&mdash;he had no
      idea a baby could be so interesting to paint. He was not sure but that he
      was going to like to paint babies even better than he had liked to paint
      his &ldquo;Face of a Girl&rdquo; that had brought him his first fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      In September the family returned to the Strata. The move was made a little
      earlier this year on account of Alice Greggory's wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was to be married in the pretty living-room at the Annex, just where
      Billy herself had been married a few short years before; and Billy had
      great plans for the wedding&mdash;not all of which she was able to carry
      out, for Alice, like Marie before her, had very strong objections to being
      placed under too great obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you see, really, anyway,&rdquo; she told Billy, &ldquo;I owe the whole thing to
      you, to begin with&mdash;even my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Of course you don't,&rdquo; disputed Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do. If it hadn't been for you I should never have found him again,
      and of <i>course</i> I shouldn't have had this dear little home to be
      married in. And I never could have left mother if she hadn't had Aunt
      Hannah and the Annex which means you. And if I hadn't found Mr. Arkwright,
      I might never have known how&mdash;how I could go back to my old home (as
      I am going on my honeymoon trip), and just know that every one of my old
      friends who shakes hands with me isn't pitying me now, because I'm my
      father's daughter. And that means you; for you see I never would have
      known that my father's name was cleared if it hadn't been for you. And&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Alice, please, please,&rdquo; begged Billy, laughingly raising two
      protesting hands. &ldquo;Why don't you say that it's to me you owe just
      breathing, and be done with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will, then,&rdquo; avowed Alice, doggedly. &ldquo;And it's true, too, for,
      honestly, my dear, I don't believe I would have been breathing to-day, nor
      mother, either, if you hadn't found us that morning, and taken us out of
      those awful rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Never! You wouldn't let me take you out,&rdquo; laughed Billy. &ldquo;You proud
      little thing! Maybe <i>you've</i> forgotten how you turned poor Uncle
      William and me out into the cold, cold world that morning, just because we
      dared to aspire to your Lowestoft teapot; but I haven't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Billy, please, <i>don't</i>,&rdquo; begged Alice, the painful color
      staining her face. &ldquo;If you knew how I've hated myself since for the way I
      acted that day&mdash;and, really, you did take us away from there, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't. I merely found two good tenants for Mr. and Mrs. Delano,&rdquo;
       corrected Billy, with a sober face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I know all about that,&rdquo; smiled Alice, affectionately; &ldquo;and you
      got mother and me here to keep Aunt Hannah company and teach Tommy Dunn;
      and you got Aunt Hannah here to keep us company and take care of Tommy
      Dunn; and you got Tommy Dunn here so Aunt Hannah and we could have
      somebody to teach and take care of; and, as for the others,&mdash;&rdquo; But
      Billy put her hands to her ears and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was to be on the fifteenth. From the West Kate wrote that of
      course it was none of her affairs, particularly as neither of the
      interested parties was a relation, but still she should think that for a
      man in Mr. Arkwright's position, nothing but a church wedding would do at
      all, as, of course, he did, in a way, belong to the public. Alice,
      however, declared that perhaps he did belong to the public, when he was
      Don Somebody-or-other in doublet and hose; but when he was just plain
      Michael Jeremiah Arkwright in a frock coat he was hers, and she did not
      propose to make a Grand Opera show of her wedding. And as Arkwright, too,
      very much disapproved of the church-wedding idea, the two were married in
      the Annex living-room at noon on the fifteenth as originally planned, in
      spite of Mrs. Kate Hartwell's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was soon after the wedding that Bertram told Billy he wished she would
      sit for him with Bertram, Jr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to try my hand at you both together,&rdquo; he coaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, if you like, dear,&rdquo; agreed Billy, promptly, &ldquo;though I
      think Baby is just as nice, and even nicer, alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once again all over Bertram's studio began to appear sketches of Billy,
      this time a glorified, tender Billy, with the wonderful mother-love in her
      eyes. Then, after several sketches of trial poses, Bertram began his
      picture of Billy and the baby together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now Bertram was not sure of his work. He knew that he could not yet
      paint with his old freedom and ease; he knew that his stroke was not so
      sure, so untrammeled. But he knew, too, that he had gained wonderfully,
      during the summer, and that he was gaining now, every day. To Billy he
      said nothing of all this. Even to himself he scarcely put his hope into
      words; but in his heart he knew that what he was really painting his
      &ldquo;Mother and Child&rdquo; picture for was the Bohemian Ten Club Exhibition in
      March&mdash;if he could but put upon canvas the vision that was spurring
      him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Bertram worked all through those short winter days, not always upon
      the one picture, of course, but upon some picture or sketch that would
      help to give his still uncertain left hand the skill that had belonged to
      its mate. And always, cheering, encouraging, insisting on victory, was
      Billy, so that even had Bertram been tempted, sometimes, to give up, he
      could not have done so&mdash;and faced Billy's grieved, disappointed eyes.
      And when at last his work was completed, and the pictured mother and child
      in all their marvelous life and beauty seemed ready to step from the
      canvas, Billy drew a long ecstatic breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bertram, it <i>is</i>, it is the best work you have ever done.&rdquo; Billy
      was looking at the baby. Always she had ignored herself as part of the
      picture. &ldquo;And won't it be fine for the Exhibition!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram's hand tightened on the chair-back in front of him. For a moment
      he could not speak. Then, a bit huskily, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you dare&mdash;risk it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risk it! Why, Bertram Henshaw, I've meant that picture for the Exhibition
      from the very first&mdash;only I never dreamed you could get it so
      perfectly lovely. <i>Now</i> what do you say about Baby being nicer than
      any old 'Face of a Girl' that you ever did?&rdquo; she triumphed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Bertram, who, even to himself, had not dared whisper the word
      exhibition, gave a tremulous laugh that was almost a sob, so overwhelming
      was his sudden realization of what faith and confidence had meant to
      Billy, his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was still a lingering doubt in Bertram's mind, it must have been
      dispelled in less than an hour after the Bohemian Ten Club Exhibition
      flung open its doors on its opening night. Once again Bertram found his
      picture the cynosure of all admiring eyes, and himself the center of an
      enthusiastic group of friends and fellow-artists who vied with each other
      in hearty words of congratulation. And when, later, the feared critics,
      whose names and opinions counted for so much in his world, had their say
      in the daily press and weekly reviews, Bertram knew how surely indeed he
      had won. And when he read that &ldquo;Henshaw's work shows now a peculiar
      strength, a sort of reserve power, as it were, which, beautiful as was his
      former work, it never showed before,&rdquo; he smiled grimly, and said to Billy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, now, that was the fighting I did with my good left hand, eh,
      dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was yet one more drop that was to make Bertram's cup of joy brim
      to overflowing. It came just one month after the Exhibition in the shape
      of a terse dozen words from the doctor. Bertram fairly flew home that day.
      He had no consciousness of any means of locomotion. He thought he was
      going to tell his wife at once his great good news; but when he saw her,
      speech suddenly fled, and all that he could do was to draw her closely to
      him with his left arm and hide his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Bertram, dearest, what&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; stammered the thoroughly
      frightened Billy. &ldquo;Has anything-happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;yes&mdash;yes, everything has happened. I mean, it's going
      to happen,&rdquo; choked the man. &ldquo;Billy, that old chap says that I'm going to
      have my arm again. Think of it&mdash;my good right arm that I've lost so
      long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Oh, Bertram!</i>&rdquo; breathed Billy. And she, too, fell to sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when speech was more coherent, she faltered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyway, it doesn't make any difference <i>how</i> many beautiful
      pictures you p-paint, after this, Bertram, I <i>can't</i> be prouder of
      any than I am of the one your l&mdash;left hand did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I have you to thank for all that, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you haven't,&rdquo; disputed Billy, blinking teary eyes; &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo; she
      paused, then went on spiritedly, &ldquo;but, anyhow, I&mdash;I don't believe any
      one&mdash;not even Kate&mdash;can say <i>now</i> that&mdash;that I've been
      a hindrance to you in your c-career!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hindrance!&rdquo; scoffed Bertram, in a tone that left no room for doubt, and
      with a kiss that left even less, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, for still another minute, was silent; then, with a wistfulness that
      was half playful, half serious, she sighed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram, I believe being married is something like clocks, you know,
      'specially at the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clocks, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I was out to Aunt Hannah's to-day. She was fussing with her clock&mdash;the
      one that strikes half an hour ahead&mdash;and I saw all those quantities
      of wheels, little and big, that have to go just so, with all the little
      cogs fitting into all the other little cogs just exactly right. Well,
      that's like marriage. See? There's such a lot of little cogs in everyday
      life that have to be fitted so they'll run smoothly&mdash;that have to be
      adjusted, 'specially at the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Billy, what an idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's so, really, Bertram. Anyhow, I know my cogs were always getting
      out of place at the first,&rdquo; laughed Billy. &ldquo;And I was like Aunt Hannah's
      clock, too, always going off half an hour ahead of time. And maybe I shall
      be so again, sometimes. But, Bertram,&rdquo;&mdash;her voice shook a little&mdash;&ldquo;if
      you'll just look at my face you'll see that I tell the right time there,
      just as Aunt Hannah's clock does. I'm sure, always, I'll tell the right
      time there, even if I do go off half an hour ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I didn't know that,&rdquo; answered Bertram, very low and tenderly.
      &ldquo;Besides, I reckon I have some cogs of my own that need adjusting!&rdquo;
     </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
